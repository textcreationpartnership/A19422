            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>EING at the laſt ouercome (right honorable) by the long and earneſt requeſt of diuers Godly and wel diſpoſed chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to yeeld my conſent to the publiſhing of this to hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſimple a worke: I forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with was reſolued in my ſelfe to dedicate the firſt fruits of my labour in this kinde of wryting vnto your honour, as to a moſt worthy MECOENAS and conuenient Patron both of all learning and good cauſes And albeit at the firſt bluſh it may ſeeme ſome what ſtraunge vnto your honour,
<pb facs="tcp:14201:3"/> that I ſhould preſume to preſent you with ſo ſimple a gift being vnworthy the view of ſo honorable a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, and wiſe. Yet becauſe I do it, not as one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting anye temporall benefite or preferment at your hand (as the maner of the worlde for the moſt part in ſuch matters is): But as a token rather of my ſpeciall good will, and duety towards you, and an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of thankfulneſſe vnto God for his graces in you, as alſo to miniſter ſome occaſion of increaſe and going forwarde, with conſtancy and Heroicall ſpirite in ſo good, gracious and Godly wayes as you haue turned your feete to ſteppe in already: I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelfe therefore of your facile and curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nature and good will in accepting of the ſame. And euen this ſmall duety of wryting is one point of the honouring and gratifying of our betters, and thoſe to whom we ſtand charged from the Lorde to perfourme duties of reuerence and honour. Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when we ſee the Image of God by the ſeconde creation, to ſhine in them, as it doth breake forth in your honourable and vertuous breſt, by many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and commendable graces and vertues, with the plauſible approbation fame and report, both of the wiſe and Godly. I ſpeake not this as one that would fill the trompe of flattery, with the winde of vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious praiſe, to ſeeme to ſpeake for your honour to the worlde (for that is not my maner) ſith your vertuous religious and Godlye wayes, ſpeake for them ſelues, to your great commendation, and your euerlaſting praiſe in Chriſte Ieſus. But I ſpeake of the worke of God in you (right honorable) that God might haue his iuſt glory in his owne worke, and your ſelfe might alſo be incouraged with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to proceede and increaſe in that good courſe, ſo
<pb facs="tcp:14201:3"/> as the worke of God which is begun might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited in you. For ſure it is (my very good Lord) that the enemy of mankind ſeeketh to beſet, as all men, ſo ſpecially thoſe, whome the Lorde beginneth to frame to him ſelfe; but chieflyeſt thoſe, that are as it were ouer frayghted with the aboundaunce of the troubleſome affayres of this preſent life, by reaſon of their great calling. For they whom God calleth to ſo great honour, riches and dignity are (as one wiſely wryteth) ſet vpon the mayne ſea of occaſions, in daunger to bee drenched and ſwallowed vp of the tempeſtuous rages, and ſurging waues of diuers temp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tations, if the Lorde doe not mightely by his grace ſupport and vnderſtay them. But when God ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth by them, and frameth their heartes to the loue of his truth, then doth he reape great honour and glory at their handes. VVhich he highly priſeth and reckoneth off, inſomuch, that he hath honorably ſpoken of ſuch by his Prophetes that they ſhoulde bring much glory to his Church,<note place="margin">Eſay. 49.23. &amp; 60.16.</note> and be nurſing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and nurſing mothers therevnto, yea the glory of LEBANON (euen of great perſonages) ſhal come togeather to beautify the place of my ſunctuary (ſaith the Lorde), for I will glorify the place of my feete.<note place="margin">Eſay. 60.13.</note> For the ſeruice which ſuch ſhoulde doe to his Church was not a ſeruile condition, but a beautifying of his Church, as it is there called, and a glory euen vnto him ſelfe. And vndoubtedly bleſſed are thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Nobles, honourable and worſhipfull, who them ſelues imbracing and obeying the truth ſincerely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come preſidentes and examples in their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to allure others to the fellowſhip of the church, to the loue of the worde and true religion. For the fall or vpriſing of many after a ſort dependeth vpon
<pb facs="tcp:14201:4"/> the publique perſons whom God hath lift vp in high places ouer others. Inſomuch as the eyes of the multi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tude are bene vpon the examples of publique perſons: Furthermore wee ſee from time to time, howe the Church of God (not without great cauſe) accounted highly of ſuch perſonages as thoſe by whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued ſpeciall bleſſings from the Lorde. So the church of Iſrael,<note place="margin">Pſal. 21.6.</note> made precious account of DAVID that worthy Prince, as one that was ſet of God as bleſſings for euer, Meaning as a benefite and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Gods fauour vpon his people. EZEKIAH, NEHEMIAH,<note place="margin">Neh. 1. &amp; 2. Hag. 1.14. Ier. 40. 2. Chr. 35.25</note> ZERVBBABEL, GEDALIAH. &amp;c. were great bleſſings to the Church, who greatly lamented the loſſe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Alſo IOSIAH, his death was lamented with a doleful lamentation of al the church of IVDA. And ſure it is that our Church hath great cauſe to magnifie the mercies of God towards vs, in truſting vs with ſo gracious a IOSIAH as our Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Princeſſe ELIZABETH; as by whoſe gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the church hath receiued many bleſſings. The loſſe of whome if our ſinns ſhould procure (which the Lord keep far from vs) would yeeld no leſſe occaſion for vs to complayne and ſay then the Churche of IVDA had,<note place="margin">Lamen. 5.20</note> at the death of IOSIAH when they ſayd, Our life &amp; the breath of our noſtrels, the annoynted of the Lorde, vvas taken in their nets, of vvhome we ſayd vnder his ſhadow vve ſhall be preſerued aliue, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the heathen. Herevnto god hath added further matter of ioy and thankfulnes vnto his Churche, in that many nobles &amp; worthy perſonages of this land both learned, Godly and wiſe, (among whom your honour hath not the leaſt roome) are faythfull Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of the cauſe of Religion. And therefore if the church reuerenced, &amp; highly accounted of ſuch, if the
<pb facs="tcp:14201:4"/> godly teachers of the church commended ſuch, and gratifyed them by wryting of ſome ſuch duety, as the Apoſtle IOHN did the elect Lady, and HIEROM,<note place="margin">2. Ioh. 1.</note> that vertuous Lady LETA, &amp; GAVDENTIA, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them in the truth, &amp; to ſhew their thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes for them vnto God: why may not we in our times likewiſe gratify our noble &amp; worthy perſonages with ſome ſuch duty? to ſhew forth our thankfulnes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence towardes them: as alſo to miniſter occaſion by ſuch means as we can, of further proceeding in all religious and godly wayes with zeal to aduance gods glory in his church? For we ſhould all ſtep out for the defence and aduancement of Gods goſpell &amp; glory. For the true honor of al men ſtandeth in this chiefly, that they imbrace the word which is the wiſdome of God, ſith without religion there is no true honour. Therfore Prou. 8, VViſdome layeth claime to all the honor &amp; kingdom of princes,<note place="margin">Pro. 8.15.16.18.</note> as without whom they wanted al true honor. Yea ſhe challengeth to her ſelfe al true wiſdome, councel, vnderſtanding, ſtrength and honour, &amp;c. Alſo els where SOLOMON a prince of greateſt hono<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> &amp; wiſdome, ſetteth down plainly,<note place="margin">Pro 4.8. ver. 14.</note> that they which imbrace wiſdome ſhal haue great honor, &amp; they which exalt her ſhal be exalted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues. For God crowneth them with honour which honour his word. But ſtrippeth al ſuch naked of honor &amp; renoum before him, which do not honor his word. Therefore the gouernours of Iſrael, were charged to be alwayes conuerſant in the booke of the law day &amp; night, that they might learne to feare the lord their God:<note place="margin">Deu. 17.19.</note> adding a great reaſon, that by ſuch meanes they ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for their own ſafety, and for the good eſtate of their poſteritie.<note place="margin">Verſe 20.</note> Yea it was promiſed to DAVID as a ſpeciall prerogatiue that ſo long as hee helde
<pb facs="tcp:14201:5"/> the Lord to be his Father and made him his God, by truſting in him and imbracing the teſtimonies of his word,<note place="margin">Pſa. 89.26. ver. 28.29.</note> that the Lorde would not fayle him, but eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhe his couenaunt with him, yea and with his ſeede for euermore. So that ſuch as ſet their delight in the word of God, carry with them ſtore of bleſſinges from the Lord, both for them ſelues and for their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. And we ſee that the Lorde doth not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe promiſe to proſper the affayres of men, then as they are carefull to know his will in his word. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it was that the Lorde promiſed the lyke ſucceſſe vnto IOSHVA. For after he had incouraged him to obey his worde,<note place="margin">Ioſh. 1.7. &amp; ver. 8.</note> ſhewing that therein ſtoode all true proſperity, he addeth this exhortation. Let not this booke of the Lawe depart out of thy mouth, but meditate therein day and night, that thou mayeſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue and doe, according to all that is wrytten therin, then ſhalt thou make thy way proſperous, and then ſhalt thou haue good ſucceſſe. For the Lorde knew, that ſith IOSHVA ſtood in great perill of temptation euery way, by the reaſon of the waightyneſſe of his calling and dignity, therefore alſo he ſheweth that hee had greateſt neede of the meanes to vnderſtay himſelfe, and to be acquainted with the Lordes priuy Councell, reuealed in his worde, to direct him in all his actions. So DAVID made the worde of God his Councellers,<note place="margin">Pſa. 119.24.</note> without whom he woulde doe nothing. For he knew that it behoueth ſuch to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their honour, glory, eſtimation, riches, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite as handmaydes to further Gods glory. And then no doubt they are to expect greate bleſſinges from the Lorde, with immortall prayſe and euerlaſting ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour with Chriſt Ieſus. I doubt not therefore (right honourable) but all theſe bleſſinges ſhall be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
<pb facs="tcp:14201:5"/> vpon you as alſo vpon your poſterity, ſith you loue and imbrace the religion of the true God and the truth of his worde, who will not ſee you want that honour that he hath promiſed to his moſt excellent Saintes.</p>
            <p>And now here I preſent vnto your Honour this poore Tallent of myne: which may it pleaſe you to accept at my hand, as of one that wiſheth all happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vnto you and yours in the Lorde, humbly cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that your fauourable wiſedome would ſupply the wants of this thing, and that this ſo ſimple a gift as it is, may be accepted of you, rather for my good meaning in the thing and the ende wherefore I doe it, then for the vallue of the thing it ſelfe.

For my labour was (in the handling of this fifth Chapiter of the CANTICLES) to lay forth as I could the calling vvhereby Chriſt calleth his Church and faythfull to the participation of his heauenly riches, and the ſuite which he maketh to bee entertained of his Church, with ſome reaſons of waight an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed vnto his ſuite, to make it the more forcible, that men might be made priuie vnto the means of their calling, which is the firſt part of the Chapiter in generall. Then ſecondly I haue noted hovve the faythfull come on by degrees and in what manner they obey their Chriſtian calling,<note place="margin">The ſecond part, the maner of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying of their calling.</note> what ſtovve proceedings they make, vvhat lets they meete withal, &amp; how they hang of and on a long time with the Lord or euer they conclude and make vp the match with him in their heartes.

For in the firſt Sermon and part of the ſecond, the ſuite of Chriſt calling his Churche to obedience and to the pertaking of his grace, is handled with ſuch reaſons alledged by him, as might mooue any tractable nature to yeeld vnto his ſuite.

For the Cloudes of the infirmities of the Saintes of GOD are ſo greate ſometimes in their ovvne ſighte (vvhen they are truely humbled) and ſo thicke that they blem sh the ſighte of Gods fauoure, ſo as they can not diſcrye the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof, at times when they couet moſte to feele it. Yea when they groane in the ſecretes of their heartes for it vnto God, calling after him by Prayer, beeing Sutors for it a long time betweene hope and diſpayre, not fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge the comforte of his fauoure but ſuſpecting rather, vvhen yet they are in beſt ſtate: yea, in beſt aſſuraunce of his grace (though they feele it not for the time).

For <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:14201:12"/> in his marriage with the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> in all his wiſdome, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, and riches, ſupported the perſon of Chriſte Ieſus: as in the <hi>45.</hi> Pſal. is manifeſt. Nowe after many things mencioned afore in this booke, which were betwéene Chriſte and his ſpouſe, in diſcouering their loue one to the other, with many other circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces, which the Tert it ſelfe ſhall yeelde vnto you: in this Chapter, <hi>Solomon</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth how Chriſt calleth his ſpouſe, making liberall and princely offers vnto her, earneſtly ſuing for entertain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, vſing many reaſons to further his ſuit, and many tokens of his loue and good will, to obtaine the fauour of his ſpouſe. Which calling of Chriſte, we had neede to bee made acquainted withall, that we may be careful to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, loue and obey him. Alſo, of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, he laieth foorth vnto vs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably, how the Church commeth on by degrees, &amp; what lets ſhe met with al in her beginnings, within and with out, at home and abroad, in her ſelf and in others: yet in the ende, ouerſtrideth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14201:12"/> all lets, and ſequeſtreth her ſelfe from the worlde, cares, and all hurtfull hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances: inquiring ſeriouſly after her loue of others, and conferring with her fellow virgins of his perſon, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, of his wiſedome, doctrine, and of the place where hee haunted: by which meanes they were allured to ſeeke after Chriſte with her: from which circumſtances, floweth holſome and comfortable inſtructions for vs in our times. Laſtly, he ſheweth how the ſpouſe aſſureth her ſelfe of the loue of Chriſte, crauing his euerlaſting pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, &amp; ſatiſfiying her ſelf in his loue. So as I wil conſider the whol ſumme of this chapter in two principal parts and after the particular braunches,<note place="margin">The Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deuided into two principall partes.</note> iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing out of theſe generall parts, as in the proceſſe of the matter I ſhall note vnto you.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 1.</note>
               <hi>I am come into my Garden, (my Siſter my ſpouſe) I gathered my myrrh with my ſpice, I ate my bony comb with my bony, I haue drunke my Wyne with my Milk, Eate O friends, drink and make you merry, O welbeloued.</hi> This ſpeech is an anſwer and reply to a former ſuite and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſpouſe or church, which ſhe had made vnto Chriſt, that he woulde vouchſafe to come and bee reſident in his garden, which is his Church, and that the comfortable winde of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, might blow vpon it, to proſper it, as in the end of the fourth chapter, ver. <hi>16.</hi> appeareth. Not that Chriſt is firſt ſought of his church before he ſeeketh that. For in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>1.</hi> Chap. the church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth ſhee can not come vnleſſe ſhe be drawne, but being once drawn on, and illumined with Gods Spirite, then
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14201:13"/> her will is reformed, and her deſires ſanctified, to long after God and Chriſt. So that after ſhe had ſomewhat ſeene into the excellency of Chriſt, ſhe coue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth to feele him more thoroughly, and to haue him make his abode with her. For the godly euer grone and ſigh, both for the encreaſe of graces already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and alſo for newe graces daily to be diſtilled into their hearts. Chriſt therefore aunſwereth, that he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken poſſeſſion of his Garden, euen of his heauenly kingdome, and that he is very rich, and able to pleaſure al his friends, ſutors, and cliants: there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth nothing vnto him, but he hath al things in aboundaunce, and without meaſure. Wherefore he replieth with a new ſuit vpon his ſpouſe and church, that ſhee wil take parte with him of thoſe his heauenly riches and ſpiritual treaſures, giuing alſo entertainmente to his owne perſonage, who had taken ſuch pain, &amp; ventred him ſelf to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſcommodities for his Churches ſake, as after followeth in the ſeconde verſe. For <hi>Solomon</hi> as I ſaide,<note place="margin">Moſes</note> was a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14201:14"/> figure of Chriſt in his marriage with the daughter of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> as Pſal. <hi>45.</hi> Now the true huſband of the Churche is Chriſt Ieſus, and none other: for <hi>he is that Bridegroome that hath the bride.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 3.29</note> Whoſoeuer therfore vſurpeth the head ſhip of the Church, beſides Chriſte the true huſbande, is a theefe and enemy to the ſpouſe. The Pope therefore is a falſe huſband, and wrongfully layeth claime to the Church, and all his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are but baſtardes. But <hi>Solomon</hi> here figuratiuely deſcribing Chriſt, to <hi>enter into his garden:</hi> vnderſtandeth both that hee hath taken poſſeſſion of his heauenlye Kingdome and riches, wher he prepareth heauenly and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal banquets for his ſaintes and elect: &amp; alſo that he is come into his Church and inheritaunce vpon earth, to make proffer of al theſe his riches and royal treaſures to his ſaints, that they may participate with him in his glory. To this end <hi>Solomon</hi> putteth vpon Chriſte the perſon of a Sutor, or woer: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth the Church vnder the perſon of a maiden or virgine, longing after
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14201:14"/> her loue. This <hi>1.</hi> verſ. and the <hi>2.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the firſt part of the Chapter,<note place="margin">the firſt part of the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſtanding in two pointes.</note> which concerneth the ſuite of Chriſte, whereby hee calleth his Churche and faithfull. This ſuite I wil giue vnto you after this manner. Firſt the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> which he vſeth in his ſuite,<note place="margin">The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> which are <hi>4.</hi> Theſe ſhal be conſidered in their place Secondly, the ſuite it ſelfe, or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of his ſpouſe,<note place="margin">The ſuite it ſelfe.</note> which becauſe it is intermedled between the reaſons. I wil note them to you as they lye, for I will not tye my ſelfe to any preziſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but note the matter it ſelf, as may be moſt forcible to mooue vs, and moſte fit for the ſenſe of the place, and edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of you.<note place="margin">The firſt reaſon.</note> He firſt beginneth with rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſons which he propoundeth, as matter to mooue his Spouſe withall, and to make a more eaſie way to his ſuite. The firſte reaſon, hee ſetteth downe in the forme of a preface or narration, which is drawne from his excellent dignitie, prerogatiue, and eternal ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which hee hath already receiued. <hi>I am come into my Garden, I gathered my Myrrh. &amp;c.</hi> He propoundeth as I ſay,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14201:15"/> his reaſons, and firſt, that he hath fair poſſeſſions, and a rich &amp; princely king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, furniſhed with al heauenly and ſpiritual commodities, and he offereth the pleaſures of this his kindome vnto his Church on earth, which he after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine calleth his garden. For I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not vnderſtand this entrance into his garden onely of Chriſtes heauenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence in glory, whither he is aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and hath taken poſſeſſion of life, but euen of his kingdome alſo, which he exerciſeth ouer his ſaints on earth. Becauſe it is an anſwere and graunt to the former ſuite of the Church that he woulde come to his garden, euen to his Church on earth, by his word and ſpirite. Hitherto tendeth the Metaphor of deſcending, chapter <hi>6.</hi> ver. <hi>2.10.</hi> So that albeit Chriſte bee reſident in the heauens, enriched and dignified with all power of thinges in heauen and earth, yet is hee preſent with his Church on earth in ſpirit, and in the miniſtery of his worde and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as the printes of the ſoals of his feete.<note place="margin">Ezech. 42.7.</note> And ſo doth ſet abroach all
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14201:15"/> his heauenly riches to vs, by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of his Goſpell, intreating vs to receiue them. Alſo we ſee that vſually Chriſtes kingdome and Church on earth, is figured by a Garden, fielde or yarde, and not his heauenly kingdome of glory, ſo as the Metaphors or ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies vſed of the holy Ghoſt els where make plaine this matter. For the Church is compared to a vineyarde, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Iere.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Math.</hi> 21.33. <hi>Mar.</hi> 12.1. By which places we find y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the church of God which is on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth is compared oft to a garden or yard. So as I conclude by theſe borrowed ſpeeches of the ſcripture, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> garden doth not onely import the poſſeſſion of his heauenly kingdome, but euen alſo his church on earth, which God gaue his ſonne an inheritance: euen to the vtmoſt partes thereof, both Iews and Gentiles, to whom he offereth his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and communicateth his heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inheritaunce to the faithfull which they apprehend here by faith, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall fully poſſeſſe in heauen with Chriſt. Chriſt here proteſteth himſelfe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14201:16"/> to haue all true felicitie, and therefore perſwadeth his Spouſe to open vnto him, &amp; participate his graces: and ſure it is, this cannot but be a great reaſon to moue vs to embrace him, ſith he is cheefe heire of al things, it is a reaſon which earthly woers vſe much, if they can report of their greate reuenewes, riches, poſſeſſions, rich friendes: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they are already in poſſeſſion, and their inheritaunce come to them already, then it carrieth ſome ſway withall, to mooue their louers to caſt ſome liking on them. So Chriſte is here diſcribed vnto vs as a Sutor, which ſtandeth not at the courteſy of his freendes, but is already inueſted and inſtalled into his roiall kingdom: and his inheritance is already deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into his hands, by his heauenlye father. This reaſon, me thinks ſhould waigh very much with vs, for it is forcible, if we haue any hearts to bee mooued. This reaſon is amplified by particulars: afterward whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith, <hi>I haue gathered my myrrh with my ſpice, I baue ate my bony comb with my hony, &amp;c</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:14201:16"/>
            <p>There is interlaced certaine ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of loue, as <hi>my ſister, my doue,</hi> which include part of another reaſon, which titles, we will conſider of afterward, when we come to the mention of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny titles giuen to the ſpouſe in the <hi>2,</hi> verſe by myrrh, ſpice, hony, wine, and mylke. <hi>Solomon</hi> figureth and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vnto vs, heauenly &amp; ſpirituall ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. For as theſe things are delicate, &amp; nouriſhable to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body, ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word &amp; the ſweet promiſes of life, are meat drink and all neceſſaries to the ſoule. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſpirite of God vnder theſe earthly benefits, commendeth the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly and ſpirituall. As Eſay <hi>55.1.2.</hi> The graces of the ſpirit of god brought to vs by Ieſus Chriſte, and conuaied into the faithfull by the preaching of the Goſpell, are called <hi>waters, wine, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, bread.</hi> And <hi>Prouerb. <hi>9.1.</hi> Wiſdome is compared to a Queene, keping open houſe, opening all her Treaſures, drawing her wines, preparing her table, bringing foorth her treaſures, and calling all to participate with her.</hi> Alſo Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Iohn. <hi>7.37.</hi> offereth to the thirstie,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14201:17"/> to drink euen of the waters of life,</hi> which after is interpreted, <hi>Iohn. <hi>7.</hi>
               </hi> ver. <hi>39.</hi> to be ment of the graces of the ſpirite of God. Thus we plainly ſee by the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed ſpeeches of the ſcriptures, that by theſe earthly benefites and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, are figured heauenly and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall graces. For the ſame that meat drinke and other pleaſures is to the body, the ſame is the worde and the riches thereof to the ſoule. Chriſt is els where compared to a Kinges ſonne that married and biddeth gueſſe to his wedding. <hi>Math. <hi>22.2.</hi>
               </hi> See then the force of this reaſon I pray you, that Chriſt intreateth to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, ſith he hath taken poſſeſſion of all riches and wanteth nothing, but is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble euery way to doe vs good. If this reaſon can preuaile with me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matters and benefites? Oh what ſhame is it that the ſame ſhoulde not preuaile with vs in heauenly ſuites, wherein ſtandeth the life of our ſouls. So God reaſoneth with Iſraell many times for his benefites, that he is able to pleaſure them, therefore they ought
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14201:17"/> to admit of him to be their God. Thus Chriſt hers after a ſort boaſteth of his riches, as ſutors make many brags of their wealth, but Chriſt hath all true welth in déed, ſo as we may reſt on his word. It is ſure a ſtrong argument to perſwade vs (if we ſaw into it aright) to grant to his loue, ſith ſo rich a ſutor vouchſafeth to make offer vnto vs. Nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther doth he require any rich dowry at our hands, only to find a faithful &amp; obe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dient ſpouſe of vs, which he himſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo worketh in his. Thus chriſt offereth liberally of his riches to al his people, to allure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to take part with him, &amp; to be married vnto him: for as I ſayd, <hi>Solomon</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perſon of a huſband or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, &amp; of a wife or mayde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as louers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth the loue which is betweene Chriſt &amp; his church. Now Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into his garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; church on earth diuers wayes, to reueale &amp; diſcouer his heauenly riches to vs. Firſt by himſelf in his own perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dais of his fleſh, and by his owne miniſterie enioyned him of his father, he came to redeeme and ſaue his ſpouſe beeing loſt, and to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14201:18"/> feoft her into his eternall inheritance layde vp in the heauens, hauing alſo committed the euidences and free deed of his gift to his Church: namely, his worde. Alſo he commeth by his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, whom he ſendeth as ſpokeſmen and friendes, for ſo <hi>Iohn</hi> calleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the Bridegromes friend. <hi>Io. <hi>3.29</hi>
               </hi> Albeit then, that Chriſt be aſcended in to his heauenly pallace, yet he ceaſeth not dayly to become a Sutor vnto vs by his preachers, diſcouering by his Goſpel,<note place="margin">Col. 1.27.</note> al his heauenly &amp; glorious ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to cauſe vs to be enamored vpon him. For as the Sutors and Woers boaſt them ſelues of their wealth, landes, riches, &amp;c. that they might the ſooner ſpeed, and make large offers of feoftments into lands, to obtain thoſe whome they loue: ſo our Chriſt ſetteth out him ſelfe as a very rich and weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy woer, who is able to beſtow a very rich dowrie on his wife, who alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of a very noble famous &amp; honora<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble parentage &amp; rich friendes, is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a rich heyre, yea the onely heyre of all thinges, and yet moſt ſweetely,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:14201:18"/> louingly, and fauourably abaſeth him ſelfe, to match with a poore, miſerable, naked, and deſpiſed maiden, hauing no friendes, voyd of ſuccour, out of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, diſeaſed, and helpleſſe, who <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek. <hi>16,</hi> in the day of her byrth was desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, no eye pittied her, cast out in the open fieldes to the contempt of her perſon, in the day of her byrth: yea left in her own bloud naked and deſpiſed.</hi> But this ſweet and mercifull ſutor, touched with the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of pittie, had compaſſion on her, when ſhe could not pittie her ſelfe (oh dolefull eſtate and deſperate) but Oh gracious and liberal loue, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed life to the dead, comfort to the diſtreſſed, and beautified her with his owne garments and iewels, yea viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her in the time of loue, comming in his owne perſon to woo her vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. See then the exceeding loue of Chriſt Ieſu towards vs miſerable and vnworthy wretches, inuicting and cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling vs, to the participation of his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſo incomparable: but wee are ſcorneful and high minded, which play as the coye Dames which are ſullen
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14201:19" rendition="simple:additions"/> and ſelfe willed, that ſay many waies, and loue many ſutors. Yea we foord of Chriſt that moſt louing and gratious woer, ſetting lighte by him, as one to homely and baſe, to graunt oure loue vnto. Oh vnkindneſſe intollerable, oh intractable frowardneſſe, oh damnable refuſall of ſo healthful offers, yet ſuche is our nicenes, that we hold aloof from ſo happy offers, and yet perſwade oure ſelues, we ſhal ſpeed wel ynough. Can it be that the Lorde will take this at our hand, that when he hath offered to match his ſon ſo baſely for our benefit, we ſhould hold ſcorne of his mercifull offers? no no, he will ſurely reuenge it vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. Wel, we ſée y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt is ſet out vnto vs, as one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath eat, drunk, &amp; ga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thered al his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities (y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is) as one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath poſſeſſion already of all thinges, is vnder no mans gardenerſhip, and liberally offereth to participate the ſame to his church. <hi>Eat O friends, drink, and be merry, O welbeloued.</hi> We ſee here the franck liberality of Chriſte, who hourdeth not vp to himſelfe, but large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giueth foorth vnto others, yea, hee
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:14201:19"/> chéereth vp his gueſts moſt comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: noting that as Chriſte feedeth his Church on earth, with the ſpirituall dainties of his worde, &amp;c. So after this life, he calleth them to the participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his heauenly and eternall ioyes. <hi>Eat, drink, &amp;c.</hi> This is part of the ſuit, containing matter of exhortrtion, to mooue the ſpouſe to participate of the heauenly riches, which he offereth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, and conueyeth them into the hearts of the beleeuers, by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of his word, wherby he aſſureth them of the right title of life, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating the riches of his grace and life vnto them, and we eat and taſte of theſe heauenly benefites here on earth by faith, ſo that vnleſſe wee thorough fayth receiue the word, and feede of it, we can haue no part w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſte in his riches. So alſo, through faith we feede vpon Chriſt in deede, in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſupper, and are nouriſhed by his body and bloud, into a new life of holines, and righteouſnes here: and vnto eternal life in the reſurrection of the iuſt: Wherefore Chriſt is deſcribed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14201:20"/> here, as one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> banqueteth his ſpouſe. But as theſe are wordes that doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine part of his ſuite: ſo alſo, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a ſeconde reaſon which he vſeth,<note place="margin">The ſecond reaſon.</note> and it is drawn from his liberal kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and frée heartedneſſe, in offering to participate his riches to his ſpouſe. For if Chriſt had bene neuer ſo able to pleaſure his church, or neuer ſo rich &amp; glorious: yet if we were not ſure that he would be liberall and depart from his riches, but that he kept al to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, it booted vs nothing: but ſith Chriſt abounding in all riche treaſures and heauenly, doth alſo depart as it were from them, to imploy his riches on vs: this ſhould greatly perſwade with vs, me thinks to yeelde to his requeſt, and take this franke offer at his handes. So that all his ſpeech is ful of reaſons and arguments to perſwade. But pity it is to ſee, how worldly men are bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh at theſe things, ye we al ſhew our contempt and neglect of theſe rich of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of the Lord towards vs. But what excuſe can wee forge, to ſhift of this ſo wonderful a loue, that we ſhould ſet ſo
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14201:20"/> light by it? Is it becauſe hee commeth no more in his owne perſon vnto vs? Why, <hi>the Heauens must containe him til he come to iudgement. Acts. <hi>3.21.</hi>
               </hi> What is it, becauſe he is poore, of low degree or meane perſonage? his riches are without price, his parentage is of God, his perſon is moſte amiable. What then? is it becauſe hee ſpeaketh by others as his ſpokeſmen, and thoſe men thraught with infirmities as our ſelues? In deede this ſticketh in the ſtomack of many, for they contemne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word, which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſuit of Chriſt, becauſe it is ſpoken by men: ſo they eſteem the ſacred word as of men, and not of God. Surely, he could haue ſent the troup of his mighty &amp; glorious Angels to make his matche, but he hath himſelfe ſpoke in his owne perſon firſt, &amp; nowe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth his ſuite to vs in his behalfe, by his miniſters and faithfull ſeruantes. For he hath put his treaſure in <hi>earthy veſsels, that the excellencye of that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er might be of God &amp; not of vs. <hi>2.</hi> Cor. <hi>4.7.</hi>
               </hi> Alſo, <hi>We are ambaſſadors in Christs steed, as though God did beſeech you through vs,

               </hi> So as the Lorde hath ordeined Paſtors and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in his church, euen of men in his own name. <hi>Paul</hi> he likewiſe labored to preſent the people a pure virgine vnto God. <hi>2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2.</hi> Let vs not therefore (my brethren) deſpiſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meanes which God hath ordeined to ſaue vs by, and to make vp the match betweene his ſonne and vs in our heartes, leaſt wee prouoke the Lords diſpleſure. If ſome great Prince ſhould ſend of his nobles as ambaſſadors vnto any of vs, or to a man of poors eſtate, to beg his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for his onely ſonne, meaning to preferre her ſo honourably, and his ſonne louing her entirely: were it not great diſcourteſye to refuſe? and woulde he not eaſily graunt to it? ſo ſith God ſendeth oute his miniſters to beg our ſoules for his deare ſonne, and requireth that we wil beſtow our ſelues vppon him: were it not a great contempt againſte God, and a worſe daunger to our owne ſoules? if wee ſhal refuſe ſo gratious an offer. Now
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:14201:21"/> as God vouchſafeth this honour to his miniſters: as to bee Suters for his ſonne to his Church, to call them to the heauenly banquet: So they muſt not labour to winne the Church to them ſelues, and to prefer their owne glory. As the Pope which woulde haue the Church at his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo commit whooredome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſte. Or as many vaine glorious teachers, which preach them ſelues &amp; not Chriſte. Alſo ſeducers, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries, &amp;c. They all play as the falſ harted man, which beeing put in truſt to ſpeake to a mayden for another, doe wooe and make ſuite for them ſelues, to tourne the liking of the mayden to their owne perſons. Thus many tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers playe the wantons with the Spouſe of Chriſt Ieſus, when they ſhould learne of <hi>Paul,</hi> to preſent her perfect vnto Chriſte. Howbeit the church of our times, hath many wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Sutors that wooe for them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and not for Chriſte. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, that ſith the miniſters of the worde, are to ſpeake for ſo noble and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:14201:22"/> heauenly a perſonage, who is a rare <hi>Phoenix,</hi> and the onely Sonne of the liuing God, ſent to his choſen Spouſe vpon earth to offer the match of life, to vnfould and diſcouer all the ſecretes of his heauenly and eternall loue, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and princely riches of his grace: that they deale in theſe waightie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, moſte reuerently, wiſely, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, carefully and faithfully, to ſpeak the Goſpell and meſſage of Chriſt as they ought to ſpeake it, and not to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelues in preaching of Chriſt. For many which preach the trueth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſort, yet ah alas, nothing regarde the weight of this ſo honorable and holy ambaſſage. For there are ſome which thinke Chriſte too baſe to bee preached ſimply in him ſelfe, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mingle with him too too much the wiſedome of mans eloquence, and thinke that Chriſte commeth naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, vnleſſe cloathed with vaine oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentaion of wordes. Others eſteeme him too homely, ſimple and vnlearned, vnleſſe he bee beautified and blazed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer with ſtore of Gréeke or Laten ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:14201:22"/> in the pulpits: ſome recken of him as ſolitarie, or as a priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with out honor and pompe, vnleſſe he bée brought foorth of them very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly, accompaned and countenaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, with the auncient Garde of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Doctors of the Churche to ſpeake for him: or els he muſt be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed out and painted with the frooth of Philoſophi, Poetry or ſuch like. And ſo regard not to preach Chriſt crucified to the Iewes. <hi>A stumbling blocke to the Grecians foliſhnes, but to them which are called both Iews &amp; Grecians, Chriſt is the power of God, and the wiſedome of God. <hi>1.</hi> Cor. <hi>1.23.24.</hi>
               </hi> I do not ſpeake againſt learning, wiſedome, the knowledge of tongues, or the fathers, aboliſhing all vſe of them, but highly eſteming of the firſte as the Lordes giftes and graces, and reuerencing the Fathers as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy inſtruments which the Lord vſed for their time. And all theſe are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, tyme, perſon, place, and fit occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeruing. But I wold gladly Chriſt might appeare in his power by the pure handling of the Goſpel, though it
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:14201:23"/> be counted fooliſhe preaching of the world. <hi>1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21.</hi> Yet it is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary meanes appointed to ſaue them that beleeue. And ſure, I cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thinke of many, which ſtudy to preach them ſelues, and to haue their giftes, (yea ſome times thoſe giftes which they haue not) to be knowne, rather then the power of God in his Goſpel, then of Babes and yong chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; which hauing any gay thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, that they themſelues think highly on, thinke all men ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in their gayes: therefore they are alwayes pointing at their gay broo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, pointes, laces, &amp;c. ſhewing euery one where they are gay. So theſe men which preach them ſelues, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes poyncting at their gaye elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence or giftes, which they ſet more by, then the pure handling of the worde. But we are in Chriſtes ſtéede, to make ſuite for him to the ſoules of men: wherefore we muſt deale faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with him, <hi>For a wicked meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger faelleth into euill, but a faythfull am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour is preſeruation.

               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:14201:23"/> I therefore (beloued) though moſte vnworthy to open my mouth in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes behalf vnto you, yet as one apoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a ſutor in the Lords cauſe and his Churches, doe beſeech you in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of Ieſus Chriſt, that you woulde be wonne vnto him: eſpouſing both body and ſoule to be at his heauenly pleaſure. O, deſpiſe not ſo gracious offers. Let it not be your pride to ſay often nay to the Lordes ſuite, it is more curteſie to let him ſpeede at the firſt. And though we haue heretofore liſtened to the ſuite of Sathan, and he hath had his pleaſure at our handes, which might giue the Lorde iuſt cauſe to caſt vs off, and not to continue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie more his ſuite to vs: yet if we will returne from our ſinfull loue of Sathan and ſinne, the worlde and our owne ſelues, to match with Chriſt Ieſus, and bee gouerned vnder him: hee will vouchſafe to embrace vs, and receiue vs to fauour. Oh, therefore good people, as you loue your owne ſouls, let me intreate, and in intreating let me obtaine, that you

O that I coulde ſo vndermine your hearts and vſe my ſpeech ſo, as I might preuaile with you, and ſpeede for ſo gracious a ſutor and louer. Alas (my deare brethren) we haue ſerued our owne luſtes too too long already. For is it not ſufficient for vs, that we haue ſpent y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time paſt of the life after the luſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gentiles, walking in wantonnes, luſtes, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, pride, ſelfeloue, couetouſnes, gluttony, drinkings, and ſuch other ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hominations? <hi>1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.3.</hi> Let the reſt of our life be conſecrate vnto God, for we haue played the filthy harlots too much, and haue mocked with the Lord a long time. We haue made many fayer promiſes and ſhewes of loue, but in vaine ſome of vs, for we haue turned to our owne filthines againe, and not liued chaſte in our ſoules be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lorde, ſo as it is wonder that he hath not giuen vs a bil of diuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment al this time, and turned vs out of doores. Let vs therefore humble our

Some thinke Chriſte to homely and plaine for them, and not gallant y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to maintayne them in their pride, in their great ruffes, gorbellies, broadred heare, and a thouſande ſuch vanities which hinder them from mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching with Chriſt. The courtlike mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions drowned in their pleaſures, are aſhamed of the playnes of Chriſt, for they that are in kinges houſen weare ſoft apparell, but Chriſte is without ſuch pompe. Otherſome refuſe him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is deformed and worne with afflictions, being loath to vndergo the croſſe with him. Otherſome imbrace him willingly, ſo farre as their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures

Other ſome vſe Chriſt as a band to couer their vnchaſt and filthy life, and as a cloake to couer their vncleanneſſe, when in profeſſing of him, they thinke to ſet a good face on the matter, &amp; countenance themſelues by him, though they priuily nouriſh &amp; pamper moſt vile &amp; beaſtly affections, yea vgleſome monſters at home, as a harlot which taketh a huſband is bear his name as an outward honeſty, and yet let out her body moſt ſhameleſly to other men, who cutteth off her ſelfe by her vnfaithfulneſſe from her huſband: So ſhal al ſuch haue a bill of diuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and bee vtterly caſte off from Chriſte Ieſus, vnleſſe they repent. Chriſt I ſay is come into his Garden by his miniſters, and ouerlooketh his Church, labouring by his worde to draw men more neere vnto him, for his word is his errande or ſuite, which

Surely there is iuſt cauſe that we ſhould yeeld to this ſuite, to eat of his pleaſures with him. to make merry with Chriſt in this his roial banquet, and to match our ſelues to him.

And true it is, vntil we are truely won vnto chriſt, &amp; affianced to him by faith, forſaking our own ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, we are in the ſtate of damnation.

For Chriſt loueth not to match with the ſoule that is ſet in the loue of this worlde, or where vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is reſident.

Finally he decked vs, that hee might loue his owne goods in vs, and came in the time of wooing in his own fleſhe: pitched the field againſt ſathan and ſinne, who had taken vs captiue, and to whom we had giuen our ſelues as ſlaues, and ſo as a valiant champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fought for his ſpouſe, iuſtled with all the powres of hell,<note place="margin">Math. 16.</note> and ſhooke the foundations of it, brake the yron gates thereof, that they ſhall not preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

For the worlde holdeth her owne in vs ſo long as it can, and we naturally wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therevnto, ſecurely ſléeping in the inticing &amp; deceiuable pleaſures therof,

And what is the reaſon that men ſleepe in theſe earthly pleaſures and profites, euen then when their heartes are by many priuie motions of the ſpirite, affectioned or moued to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chriſt after a ſort? Or why are men ſo hindred from yeelding wholy vnto chriſt by theſe tranſitory things? For ſooth, becauſe Sathan abuſeth the lawfull thinges of this life to poyſon man withall.

Howbeit Chriſte teacheth vs to take another courſe, Math. <hi>6.33. <hi>First to ſeeke the kingdome of God, and the righteouſneſſe thereof, and then all other things ſhall be cast vnto vs.</hi>
               </hi> Alſo Paul teacheth vs to vſe theſe thinges, as though we vſed them not, hauing our affections remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and freed from them, leaſt they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come incombrances to fetter and cloy vs, that we fayle in heauenly duties. Lo then, how y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaints of God alſo are many times holden a loufe from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of Chriſt, and liſtening to the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:14201:32"/> voyce of his worde, euen then, when their heartes linger after him. Thus haue they lets in them ſelues and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towardnes to keep them from a choer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful following of Chriſt. But we muſt valiantly ſtriue againſt theſe lets, and ouerſtryde al ſtumbling blocks, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten towards him whom we loue. For we ſhal be ſure to be holden backe y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, yea: euen our ſelues finde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies to driue off y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time in following, our God calling vs. For the pleaſures and profites of this life do ſo ceaze vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon our affections, to take them vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſeruice of the world ſathan and ſinne, that we haue ſmal luſt to ſerue God as is required. Any of all the ſaintes of God can eaſely teſtifie with me, that euen when Chriſt hath by the preaching of his worde ſomewhat drawne our heartes towardes him, yet we make ſtay at euery ſmal let, vnleſſe we are marueilous watchful ouer our ſelues. For how hath the Lorde made ſuite to vs, and preſented it to our heartes, by many priuy moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his ſpirite: which we quench a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:14201:32" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſometimes, hauing our heartes poſſeſſed againe with filthy luſts. We make many beginninges and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings on. But alas, if ſathan make neuer ſo little ſuit to vs in the behalfe of our own luſtes, pleaſures or profits, how ſoone are we a ſleepe at Chriſtes ſuit? but marueilous waking vnto the ſuit of Sathan, though ſometime the heart goeth againſt it. Some are loath to be weaned from their vaine compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, when they haue yet ſome lingring in their hearts after Chriſte. Some haue much a doe to renounce ſpeciall ſinnes, that haue deepely rooted and ſtrongly ruled in their nature afore their calling. Otherſome loath to yeelde vp their pleaſures, gaminges, profites, riches, eſtimation, honor, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, &amp;c. I meane not that they ſhoulde vtterly caſt off their honor, or calling, but renounce the ouermuch loue of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which holdeth them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of God ſincerely, or furthering of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> carefully. Otherſome are hol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>den a ſléep in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cares of this life, ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercharged w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the troubles of a family
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:14201:33"/> and croſſe thinges in their houſholde, become drowzie and ſlacke to liſten vnto Chriſte, ſo as many ſtep backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. If God cal ſome ruffian, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous wicked man, or one that hath beene a companion of vaine perſons: then this commeth into his head, if I take this courſe, and follow the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his word, and keepe company with the Godly, ſure the worlde wil point me out, I ſhall be laughed at of my companions, and ſo ſhall become a ſigne to nod the head at amongſt men. Thus ſhame diſputeth with many men, when God beginneth to turne their heartes, and to worke in them a diſliking of their former life, ſo as men aunſweare their inward calling, but as men in a ſleepe and halfe amazed, til God worke further in them. Alſo, when God beginneth to frame the heart of ſome honorable or worſhipful man, to the obedience of his Goſpel, to here it, and preferre the preaching of it, then theſe replies are made of the worlde, which hold them in a ſlumber for the time. Syr (ſay they) you ſhall
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:14201:33"/> looſe your eſtimation in the court, and among the great men, you ſhall not be ſo regarded as you haue beene: ſuch grauitie and melancholike paſſions of ſadnes as the Goſpell bringeth, beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not your honorable and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful eſtate. Theſe are the engines of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, yea theſe are his charmes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he laboureth to lull euen the Godly a ſleepe, that they might not cheerfully waight vppon their calling. But the ſaints of God, though in their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges, theſe thinges may ſomewhat weigh with them for a time, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely, if their heartes doe truely lye after Chriſte, they ſtriue exceedingly with them ſelues by prayer vnto God, till they haue gotten the maſtery in theſe things.</p>
            <p>My ſelfe (moſt miſerable and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched man that I am) haue had good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the daungerous pulbackes and lets, which lye hid in our nature to lull men a ſleepe, and make them drouzie. For when my heart in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of my calling, began to yeelde towards the Lord, and to be ſomewhat
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14201:34"/> wakened: then the pleaſures of ſinnes paſt, the ſhame of reproches which I ſaw to be vttered of the world againſt the Godly, the baſenes of the Goſpell, the daungers of trials in the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of chriſt Ieſus, the glittering and deceiuable pleaſures of this life, the holding of friendſhip with the worlde and worldly friends: but eſpecially the manifolde daungers and intollerable waightines of this high calling of the preaching of the word, to deale with it purely and ſincerely, as in the ſight of God: from God through Chriſt, theſe thinges helde tacke with me a long time, and a thouſand other thinges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed me: ſo as I aunſweared my calling at the firſt, but as one a ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, or in a ſleepe or dreame.</p>
            <p>Let euery man therefore among you in good earneſt, deale with his owne heart, for it is full of deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Euery moouing of the hearte, and hopping for ioye after Chriſt, is not a right moouing. For ſo he that receiued the ſeede with ioye. Math. <hi>13.20.</hi> might haue beene in Chriſt,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14201:34"/> who yet vanniſhed againe. Thou mayeſt thinke that thy heart is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous affectioned after Chriſte, and that thou ioyeſt in him, when as thy affection truely tryed, is altogeather carnal and filthy. Yea many no doubt perſwade them ſelues, that they haue Chriſt ſure in their heartes, that they are in his fauour, that they are euen hugged in his armes, and that they ſhall bee ſaued by him, as well as the beſt: which yet neuer ſo much as truely knew Chriſt, nor taſted of him, and are furtheſt off from being ſaued by him. A man would think (belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) that there could not be any ſuch deceitfulnſſe in mans hearte, that when they are moſt ſure, they ſhould be moſt deceiued. The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they perſwade themſelues to be of Chriſt, if they do but ſpeak of him, though the fruictes and effectes of Chriſts reſidence, are not to be ſeen in them. For when Chriſt truely taketh poſſeſſion of men, &amp; occupieth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> roome of their harts, there his death is ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, to expell Sathan, the worlde, ſinne,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:14201:35"/> euil thoughtes, yea to deſtroy and pull downe ſathans kingdome. Alſo his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection is not idle in his ſaints, but ſanctifieth the heart, thoughts, minde, will, affections, and vnderſtanding: yea, reformeth the whole man within and without, that he is chaunged, and becommeth a new creature, his words lookes, geſtures, and all his members bewray a holy and ſpiritual chaunge: which although it be not wrought all at once, but by degrees, yet men muſt not loyter and flacke their pace to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to perfection. I haue marked by experience within theſe fewe yeares, that many whom the Lord hath called to the loue of his Goſpell, from their former euil and ciuill life, that they haue bene very diligent and painefull in hearing the worde, at the firſt neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting their callings and trades, (yea more then was expedient ſometimes) yet after a while when they had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what waded in the worde, that they haue come to ſome knowledge or ſome other gift, haue againe much neglected the worde, prayer, and other holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:14201:35"/> both in publick, and alſo in their priuate families: and ſo againe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſleeping in their pleaſures and profites. Thus men ſleepe, and are eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drawne to it, but let them take héed that their hearts ſleepe not. It ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Chriſtians in hand, to looke to them ſelues, ſith they haue ſo daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a nature and deceauable, as alſo ſo hurtful enemies of Sathan and the world. Many a man and woman when God calleth them, and their hearts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ayme after the Lorde, and they are forced to acknowledge the power of his word, and to condemne and find fault with their corruptions, yet they ſleepe. One deferreth of the Lord with this excuſe, Oh I haue a trade, and I muſt follow it, I could find in my hart to heare the worde, and to doe as other do, but I muſt liue, and I pleaſe God as wel ſayth another, in my trade, &amp;c. as in going to Sermons. Here is a ſleepe that falleth vpon men, that they might not wake at the Lords call and ſuit. Why? God promiſeth not to bleſſe any man in his calling (though he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpereth
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:14201:36"/> the contemners to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation &amp; ſomtime, to make them inexcuſable) vnleſſe they are carefull to obey his word and wil. And it is a greater worke to worſhip God (and to heare his worde, is a part of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) then to labour in our trade. I bind no man from following his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but to bee diligent in it, yet ſo that the Lorde haue his part at our handes, and that wee ſerue not oure owne turnes and the worlds, and ſo neglect the Lordes worſhip, yea and our owne ſaluation, which is brought vnto vs by the preaching of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpell. Others there are, whoſe heartes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what melt at the word, praier and good things, &amp; would fain haue part in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but eyther ſome ſeueral ſinnes, which they do not thoroughly ſet them ſelues againſt, and vſe means to mortify, but they breake forth at euery occaſion, ſo as they are a ſléep againe, and yet the heart may haue ſome waking after Chriſt. Theſe do hinder them, &amp; make their heart almoſt a ſléep, and faint vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any duties, or els wanting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> means
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:14201:36"/> to ſtir them vp, &amp; being of themſelues lubbriſh to ſeek y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> means (hauing their minds too much occupied in the world) or els ſhame deteining them, or feare of laws taking holde of them, &amp; of the wicked ſpying them out, &amp;c.) they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect all good meanes that may do them good. Thus euery man may complain and ſay, I am aſleepe, but few ſee the daunger of their ſleepe, and ſo labor to ſtirre vp themſelues from ſleep, as the ſpouſe doth here: but it is to be feared, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many men are a ſleepe, euen in their hearts, which hope better of themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and that is a dangerous ſleepe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake therfore truely out of ſleeep and ſinne not. Let vs therfore (good chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the loue of Chriſt Ieſus and of our own ſoules) ſearche and ſuruey all the corners of our harts, that there lie hid nothing in vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> may holde vs back fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> following of Chriſt: yea, let euery one of vs ſay, here Lord: we are at ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to wait vpon thée, our ſouls &amp; body doth delight in the liuing God. That we may thus ſhake of al ſleepy, drowzy, &amp; worldly cares &amp; affections, and watch<pb n="56" facs="tcp:14201:37"/> to wayt vpon the Lordes call, that we may be ready, willingly at a beck, to imbrace him heartely in our ſoules: which grace God graunt vs. Amen. Thus we ſee in this circumſtance, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lets that is interlaced here in a word, what lets are with in vs, which make our hearts heauy to looke vp to Chriſt Ieſus. Yet we muſt note y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſpouſe laboured to waken herſelf, and giueth not place to ſleeping, but muſeth and calleth to minde her louers voyce, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuit to be intertained.

Let not ſathan, or ſinne, or the world, ſo ſoone whiſper in our ears, to allure vs to any vncleannes, but let vs ſtraight way anſwere: Oh I heare the voice of Chriſte, calling me ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, I muſt waight vppon him and obey his word, &amp;c.

Yea, God worketh both the will and the déed of his owne good pleaſure. Phil. <hi>2.13.</hi> Notwithſtanding here ariſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations in the fleſhe. Either we wil challenge too much to our ſelues, or els wilfully ſet againſt the Lordes grace offered, and ſo ceaſe doing wel, ſaying: if I be choſen, then whatſoeuer I do, I ſhal be ſaued: if I be a reprobate, then what ſoeuer good I do, I ſhal periſhe. Thus men murmure againſte God, and woulde bring him to account of his owne workes, ſitting like proud men in the ſeate of the Lordes iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, arreigning him, as though they
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:14201:41"/> would compel God to hold vp his hand at the barre. O intollerable pride, Oh damnable blaſphemy. If thou art cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, then ſhalt thou in time feele of the fruite of thy election in Chriſt, by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and ſanctimonie. For therfore hath God elected his, that in time they may be called to be ſaintes. Rom. <hi>1.7. 1.</hi> Cor. <hi>1.2.</hi> Yea, <hi>he hath choſen vs before the foundation of the world, that we ſhuld be holy and without blame before him.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ. <hi>1.4.</hi> So then, this is the euidence of our election, and ſo of our ſaluation, if we labour for holineſſe and a new life. For ſo God ſanctifieth his vnto a new life, and refourmeth them to haue their hearts open, that ſo being renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they open vnto Chriſt. So that it followeth not, that if thou art elect what ſoeuer thou doſt thou ſhalt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. But if thou art elect, then God calleth thée in time vnto ſanctification, to renounce ſin and thine owne luſts, and ſo cauſeth thee to make ſure thy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection by good fruits, as are mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Col. <hi>3.12. <hi>As the elect of God holy and beloued, put on tender mercy, kindnes,

               </hi> with al the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new man. And read I pray you the firſt Chapter of the ſecond E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle of Peter, verſes. <hi>5.6.7.8.9.10.11</hi> So then who ſoeuer is in Chriſt muſt become a new creature. <hi>2.</hi> Cor. <hi>5.17.</hi> And who ſo euer neuer taſteth of true mortification, holineſſe and newnes of life, forſaking ſin and vngodlines, can neuer haue euidence of ſaluation, but remaine ſtill in damnation, and the wrath of God abideth vpon him. And as for the other obiection, where they ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if they be reprobates, &amp;c. what ſo euer good they do, yet they ſhal be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. This followeth not neither, ſo as they take it. For although the purpoſe of God in the reprobate can not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, yet they muſt know that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe of their deſtruction is of them ſelues, who beeing left of God to them ſelues in the matter of their condemnation, do periſh of them ſelues, and wilfully deſpiſe the ſacred meanes of life, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their heartes, and ſhutting them vp againſte Chriſte, by that malice which is reſident in their own nature.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:14201:42"/> Then how ſoeuer man murmureth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God calling them to obedience, as thogh God required ſome vnlawful or vnreſonable thing at their handes.

But they neglect not the hearing of the worde, prayer, and all the ſoueraigne meanes of their ſaluation. For they know that as God worketh all in all, ſo he hath appointed ordinary meanes, to cauſe his graces to be effectual in his ſaints, as the preaching of his word,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> the vſe of the Sacraments and prayer, &amp;c. And ſure it is, who ſoeuer is in the way of life, delighteth in theſe meanes. But he that contemneth or neglecteth theſe meanes, neglecteth his owne ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hauing no true taſte of Chriſt, and ſo open not vnto him: in ſo much as the doore of vtterance is cloſed vp in them, their heartes not beeing opened by the keyes of the worde, which beeing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Peter and the Apoſtles, haue ſucceſſiuely beene deliuered to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the word. In deed the Lord muſt firſt open our heartes, booring through our ears (as Dauid ſpeaketh) by his ſpirite: yet this hindreth not,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14201:43"/> but that the worde openeth them alſo by preaching, conueying as it were the ſpirite into the hearts of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and therfore is called the miniſtry of the ſpirite. <hi>2.</hi> Cor. <hi>3.8.</hi> I will not ſtand to confute the <hi>Maniches,</hi> nor the <hi>Minium ſpirituales</hi> which deuide the ſpirite from the worde, when the worke togeather in the faithfull, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wil I trifle with the Scholiaſtes, and Papiſtes, affirming that freewil, though it be holpen by grace: Yet is it in vs to deſerue righteouſnes, &amp;c. they may eaſely be confuted by the former places alleaged. I need not delay time to frame any ſeuerall concluſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them in any <hi>Syllogistical</hi> forme. I conclude therefore generally, that they which open vnto Chriſt, doe open by the grace of God, clenſing and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring their hearts thervnto through his worde, and ſo as a fruitful cauſe, bringeth foorth neceſſary effectes of faith &amp; obedience. And they which do not open, being left in their own ſins by the iuſt iudgement of God, through their owne fault open not, and not
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:14201:44"/> through any defect or fault in God, or in the meanes whereby hee offereth grace, but they refuſe it. Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore craue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God would vouchſafe to ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our eies that we ſleep not in death Alſo to open our eares, hearts, minds, and ſouls, and forbeare them by his ſpirite that his worde may enter and Chriſt may haue place in vs, that we may open vnto him at his ſuite and requeſt, and ſo we may heartely byd him welcome. See then I pray you this ſuite and calling of Chriſte, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vs to open vnto him and to giue him entertainement in our heartes, which friendly offer of his, to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to abaſe him ſelfe to dwell in our ſinneful bodyes and ſoules, ſhould me thinkes greatly mooue vs, ſith it is not for his owne benefite but for our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall good. But let vs now go on to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the other two reaſons which are ſet downe after his ſuite. For the calling of Chriſte or his ſuite to his Church is interplaced betweene the foure reaſons which I noted before.<note place="margin">The 3. rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> 
               <hi>My ſister, my loue, my Doue, my vndefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:14201:44"/> Theſe titles and all thoſe before named, <hi>as Spouſe, Friendes, beloued, &amp;c.</hi> they include in them ſelues a nother reaſon to mooue the Spouſe with all, drawne from the loue of Chriſte in making choyce of the faithfull to bee as his Wyfe and Spouſe. As if he ſhoulde ſaie: ſith I haue vouchſafed to caſt my loue vpon you, and to chooſe you for my Wyfe, and haue reckoned of you as of my deareſt friendes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſanctified you to my ſelfe: thinke it not much to graunt me this curti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie againe to open vnto me and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine my perſon, ſubmitting your ſelues to my good will and pleaſure, which can not but wiſhe your good and welfare euen as myne owne. This is the reaſon why hee vſeth ſuche titles of loue to bewray what good will hee beareth to the faythful, and therefore adorneth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with theſe Epithets. The title of <hi>Sister</hi> noteth the ſpiritual kindred which we haue with Chriſt, as him ſelfe calleth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beléeuers which do y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wil of his heauenly father. Mat. <hi>12.50. <hi>His mother, ſister &amp; brother.</hi>
               </hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:14201:45"/> This ſhoulde be a maruailous meane to mooue vs to loue him againe, ſith he vouchſafeth ſuch friendly and familiar names to vs, which are of our ſelues meere harlots and of kin to Sathan. But they are all borrowed titles of Chriſt, and ſpecial prerogatiues to the faithful. Eſpecially this, that he inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teleth vs his <hi>Spouſe and Loue:</hi> as alſo Iohn calleth the Church the Bryde. Ioh. <hi>3.29.</hi> Alſo Paule. Epheſ. <hi>5.28.32.</hi> calleth the Church the wife and ſpouſe of Chriſt. The title of <hi>Doue,</hi> as it is a word of loue, ſo it doth not vnfitly note vnto vs the innocencye, ſimplicity, comelines, and chaſtity, which ſhould be in the ſaints. As we find alſo, that the Gentiles which ſhould flock to the Church vnder the Goſpel, Eſay. <hi>60.8.</hi> are compared to Doues, which flocke to their windowes. Chriſt alſo tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth his Diſciples to be innocent as Doues. The title of <hi>Friendes and belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,</hi> is the ſame which he gaue to his Diſciples to be his friendes, for ſo by imputation hee accounteth vs, which before were his enemies. Rom. <hi>5.10.</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:14201:45"/> Col. <hi>1.21. <hi>My vndefiled, or perfect one.</hi>
               </hi> This title is wholy borrowed from Chriſt as the other, in whom we y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are filthy and loathſome in our ſelues, are yet in him purged from all vnclennes, as Ephe. <hi>5.26.27. <hi>He hath ſanctified &amp; cleanſed his Church, by the waſhing of water through the worde, that he might make it vnto him ſelfe a glorious Church, not hauing ſpotte or wrinckle, but that it ſhould be holy and without blame.</hi>
               </hi> Thus he amiably, inticeth and allureth vs to taſt of his ſpirituall graces which he hath brought from heauen, indignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs with honorable and gratious titles in Chriſte, not that we are ſuch of our ſelues: but Chriſt by imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on applieth that vnto vs, which is not ours, but his owne proper, &amp; imputeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vnto him ſelfe (for our cauſe) which is not his owne but ours: namely ſin, ſo that by imputation Chriſte was counted and made ſinn for vs, that we might be <hi>made the righteouſnes of God in him. <hi>2.</hi>
               </hi> Cor. <hi>5.21.</hi> Yea, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſimilitude of ſinful fleſhe, and for ſin, he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned ſin in the fleſhe, that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:14201:46"/> of the law might be fulfilled in vs, which walke not after the fleſh but after the ſpirite. Rom. <hi>8.3.4.</hi> So then Chriſte hath giuen ſinne the foyl and bounde Sathan to the good abea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that there is no condemnation to thoſe which are in Chriſte Ieſus, but they ſtand as pure, holy, and vndefiled in Chriſt Ieſus before God his father, which before were moſt vile and filthy in themſelues. This is the happy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite which we haue by Chriſte, to be flocked into the heauenly ſociety of our ſpirituall huſband, which were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſte before, and aliants from the common weal of Iſrael, ſtrangers from the couenaunt of promiſe, and were without hope and without God in the worlde. Ephe. <hi>2.12.</hi> Then, ſith now wee are made one with Chriſte, and he hath choſen vs to be his Spouſe and wife, making ſo high account of vs, preferring and commending vs, with ſo honorable and gratious titles, let vs labour to bee ioined with him, imbracing him and ſolacing our ſelues in his loue, repenting vs of our former

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:14201:47"/> patience of Chriſt Ieſus towardes his Church, that had ſo long wayted for an anſweare, and borne ſo many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities. As if he ſhoulde ſay, O my Spouſe, or you people to whom I ſpeake by the miniſtery of my worde, euen as hee which watcheth many nights bare headded, is bedewed with the myſt of the nightes, and not with the dewe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning, ſo I haue long wayted to be receiued and imbraced of you in my word, I haue ſuſtayned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite daungers and paineful labors to pleaſure you: but you haue foorded me off from time to time, that I am as one weary, fainting, and diſcouraged, ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore open vnto me, leaſt I depart and caſt you off. A maruailous ſpeech, but we muſt take vſe of it to our ſelues. For hath not Chriſte made intreatie vnto vs, and tarryed for vs, not one night or many, but euen whole yeares he hath continued his ſuite without intermiſſion to vs in this lande, and hath beene a Sutor this <hi>24.</hi> yeares, by the preaching of his word: And yet alas poore Chriſte, he may ſtande and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:14201:47"/> ſtarue abroade, for any entertainment he hath with the moſt. Can we heare that Chriſt tooke ſuch great paine for vs, as we heard before? And can we be ſo blockiſh and vnkind towardes him againe? This reaſon might mooue vs more, if we looke thoroughly into it. The Lord ſometime reaſoneth in ſuch like maner by his Prophetes, that he ſpent his ſtrength in vaine,<note place="margin">Eſay, 49.4.</note> and for nothing, to ſhame the people withal, who had cauſed the Lorde to labour in vaine by his ſeruaunts, and ſo be moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to repentaunce.

Oh let vs take héed (my brethren) leaſt that by our ſcorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full refuſall of the Lordes long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce and labour, we cauſe the Lord to vſe this reaſon againſt vs, to our condemnation in the daye of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if it be not, now a reaſon to mooue vs to repentaunce, and to open vnto the Lorde after ſo long a ſuite.

               </hi> Some vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande this, as though the Spouſe ſhould confeſſe her nakednes and that of her ſelfe ſhe had nothing, neither was able to riſe to open. Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion as the Spouſe might iuſtly make, yet becauſe the ſpeeche and wordes properly affoorde no ſuch ſenſe in my iudgement the Metaphors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſidered, I can not therfore wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly receiue that interpretation. Firſt for that then the ſpouſe ſhoulde acknowledge, that ſhe had put of that which ſhe neuer had. For we are by nature naked and voyd of grace, and ſo haue not caſt it of, ſith we neuer haue
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:14201:49"/> it, till the Lorde inſtilleth it into vs. Secondly, the other Simile, or rather metaphor <hi>of waſhing of feete,</hi> can not properly note our nakedneſſe, vnabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or emptines of grace, for that the ſcripture vſually taketh the waſhing of the feete for ſanctification and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the affections, as Eccleſiaſtes. <hi>4.17.</hi> Ioh. <hi>13.10.</hi> and ſo pure handes for pure affections, <hi>1.</hi> Tim. <hi>2.8.</hi> Other reaſons I could alleadge from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but theſe ſuffice me. Others take it (and more properly) as if the ſpouſe ſhould reaſon, that ſith ſhe is once clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſhe would not defile her ſelf again, and ſo promiſeth to grow in ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the reaſon is very forcible, (if wee take it in this ſence) that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath ſanctified, iuſtified and freed vs from ſinne, it were vnſeeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and a ſhame that we ſhould againe defile our ſelues, and ſo fruſtrate our ſelues of the fruite of Chriſtes death, and cleanſing ſacrifice offered for our ſinnes. For the benefite of our clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and redemption, ſhould be ſo farre from miniſtring occaſion of ſinne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:14201:49"/> vs, or to preſume on Gods mercyes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſhould be the greateſt argument to ſtirre vp our ſelues, to holines and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctimony, as the Apoſtle reaſoneth. Ro. <hi>12.1.</hi> By the mercies of God, to cauſe the <hi>Romaines</hi> to offer vp them ſelues wholy a ſpirituall and holy ſacrifice to God. So that in this ſenſe, the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor agreeth with the ſpeeches that Paule vſeth. Col. <hi>3.</hi> and els where, hidding vs to put off the olde man, &amp;c. So that by tranſlation, our owne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, with the appurtenances is compared to a coate both olde &amp; paſt wearing, which bring nothing but ſhame in the vſe of it, therfore to be put off. And true it is, we can not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe come vnto Chriſt, neither will he receiue vs, vnleſſe we deny our ſelues, laying a ſide all our owne luſtes and carnall affections, which all are rotten ragges that cauſeth Chriſt to loath vs. For as he that hath lyen long in pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in one coate, olde and louzie: men would be loath to company with him, and would be ſquamiſhe to eat, drink or lodge with him, vnleſſe he be new
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:14201:50"/> ſhifted, ridde of his lice and wel ayred. So if we will haue fellwoſhip with Chriſte our huſband, we muſt leaue our ſelues behind, and wayte on him, we muſt be well ayred, ſweeted and ſhifted, els Chriſt will be ſquaymiſhe of our company. For he hath redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vs out of the pryſon of Hell and Sinne, where we were forlorne, hath alſo waſhed renſed and bathed vs in his owne bloud, not to goe wallow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in the myre of ſinne, but to walke in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe before him, beeing arayed and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with the garmentes of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite and decked with the new man. In deede there are many ciuill men and carnall Goſpellers that can afoord the Lorde ſome outwarde reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in wordes or behauiour, as though they woulde put off their coat, but they neuer deale in truth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their heartes to root out from thence the root of bytterneſſe altering their will, thoughts and affections. For Chriſt loueth to dwell in the priuy Chamber of our heartes and to bear rule there.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:14201:50"/> When ſhe ſaith that ſhe hath waſhed her feet, it is ment of the affections as before I noted, importing that the ſaintes of God when they feele them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſanctified and prepared to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Chriſt,, they féele ſuch benefit by his preſence, that they ſtirre vp them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by al means, that they may not turne back againe to their own luſtes and corruptions, but labour to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate them ſelues wholy body and ſoul to the Lorde, that whereas they haue before in their members ſerued ſinne, ſathan and their owne luſtes, hauing let them out and bound them as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices vnto ſatha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now they make new vowes and couenantes with the Lorde that they will giue ouer their members as inſtrumentes of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe vnto God. Then here is no way for Ciuill men ſo long as they are meere Ciuill men, nor for world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges, couetous men, Athiſtes, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerds, raylers, proud perſons, Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, or any ſuche like, to come vnto Chriſte, till their corrupt nature bee caſte off, and their affections
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14201:51"/> waſhed, ſanctified and reformed. Yea, and this not for a time, but wee muſt vowe it for euer. For it is impoſſible that they which haue taſted of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly gift, and were made partakers of the holy ghoſt, hauing taſted of the <hi>good worde of God, and of the powers of the world to come, if they fall away, ſhould be renued againe by repentance.</hi> Heb. <hi>6.4. <hi>If the righteous ſcarcely bee ſaued,</hi>

Theſe ſhal howle with pitifull ſhrikes and ſhril voices, when they ſhall bee ſhut out from the bridegrome Chriſte Ieſus in his comming. Then ſhal they lament their whoredoms, gluttonies, pride, contempt, their railings, vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, and al their vnhappy wayes, but too late. Let vs therefore, (deare bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) craue Gods ſpirite to waſh our affections and cleanſe our hearts, that we draſſe them not in the dirt of ſinne any more, leaſt our latter end, be worſe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:14201:51" rendition="simple:additions"/> then our beginning. But albeit this be the more receiued interpretation, which I haue nowe longeſt ſtayed in: namely, that ſith ſhe is cleanſed, ſhee wil not defile her ſelfe againe. Yet mee thinkes it is to be taken of the excuſes which the Spouſe made, ſhewing that ſhee had muche a doe to renonunce her pleaſures, and complaineth that ſhe is vntoward to obey her calling, hauing many lets, as if a man being in bed is loath to riſe and diſeaze himſelf in the night: ſo the Spouſe though deſirous to ariſe to Chriſte, yet her pleaſures ſtick ſome what in her ſtomacke, and ſhe findeth many delais in her nature, debateth the matter before ſhee can cheerefully riſe vp to follow the call of Chriſt Ieſus. The reaſons that mooue me to this ſence, are theſe cheefly, <hi>1.</hi> becauſe it is an anſwere to the former ſuite of Chriſte, deſiring to be opened vnto, as one knocking in the night, ſhe aunſwereth ſhe hath put of her coate and is at reſt, hauing waſhed her féete (as the manner of that country was) ſo as ſhe was loath to riſe and ray her
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:14201:52"/> feete, diſcouering her vntowardneſſe. Now if ſhe ſhold anſwere when Chriſt calleth, that ſhe is clenſed and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how ſhold ſhe be, vncleanſed again and ſanctified? (when Chriſt calleth to ſanctification) it were a weake aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to the requeſt of Chriſt. <hi>2.</hi> The metaphor of ſleep and of the night, and al circumſtances (in a word) aford this ſenſe as moſte naturall and proper to this place. So then the vſe of it, is to teach vs howe harde beginninges wee haue in our calling, howe ſlowly wee come forward, and how many delayes our corrupt nature findeth to ſhift of al true obedience to Chriſte Ieſus. For we muſt know that our condition and eſtate is figured vnto vs in the perſon of the ſpouſe. Therefore purpoſely, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſheweth how we hang of &amp; on, with Chriſte til the Lord hath throuh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye humbled vs and weaned vs from our ſelues, which is a doctrin moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and comfortable, that we maye be ſtirred vp to ſhake of all drowſines and loytering. For we ſee how hardly we obey our calling, and liſten to the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:14201:52" rendition="simple:additions"/> word of God, but we aunſwere a farre off, and hould our ſelues aloofe. As <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi>

And we ſcant perceiue who calleth vs. Faine wee wold follow God and come to heauen, but we are loath to foyle our féete to ſtep the way that leadeth thither.

As verſe <hi>8.</hi> So that faith ſtandeth not at a ſtay in the ſaintes,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:14201:53"/> but increaſeth by degrees: as we ſee in <hi>Nicodemus</hi> and <hi>Ioſeph.</hi> For <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> Iohn. <hi>7.50.</hi> ſpake boldly in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes cauſe before the Phariſyes, though he receiued a checke:<note place="margin">Mar. 15.43.</note> and both he and Ioſeph, Iohn. <hi>19.38.39.</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their zeale after, in a coſtly and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable buriall of Chriſt Ieſus, euen then, when greateſt daunger was. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo is charged after his denial, that when hée is conuerted, he ſhoulde ſtrengthen his brethren. So that we muſt not cocker and flatter our ſelues in our poore beginninges, as though God required no more then we can do, or to beginne and ſtande at a ſtay, but we muſt increaſe in faith, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, zeal, and loue vnfained towards our brethren, alſo in care to further o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, eſpecially thoſe of our charges and families. We ſée then, that it is a harde thing to follow Chriſt, it muſt coſt vs our pleaſures and profites, yea euen our ſelues wholy. Therfore Pſa. <hi>45.10.</hi> The Spouſe of <hi>Solomon,</hi> which is a figure of the Church, is taught, that ſhe can not be fit for doctrine and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:14201:54"/> inſtruction and for her huſband, til ſhe had forgot her own people and her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, ſo caſting off all carnall affections to obey Chriſt onely. Now this we do maruailouſly vnwillingly til y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lorde put vs forward. And in déed God meaſureth his graces by degrees to his ſaintes, partly to diſcouer our owne miſeries, wants, vntowardnes, and vnfitneſſe to heauenly thinges, as alſo the hardneſſe of repentaunce, that ſo we may bee humbled and forced to ſeeke vnto God to obtaine grace to grow vnto perfection, and to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God for his owne worke in vs. Partly alſo that we ſhould not lift vp our ſelues to contemne the ſmal begin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ninges in our brethren, but labour to drawe them on, ſith we haue found it hard in our ſelues. So that the difficul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty of the thing, would ſtir vs vp to vſe the meanes the more carefully to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. As the hearing of the word ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing our ſelues in it with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual &amp; earneſt praier.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:14201:54"/> vntowardnes, that wrangle with the Lorde a long time before we yéeld and haue many out Lanes to turne a ſide from him.</p>
            <p>If therefore men will prooue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to belong to Chriſte, (though they feele many lets in them ſelues) yet that ſhall not excuſe them, but they muſt labour againſt all lets, and indeuour to reſemble the Image of Chriſt Ieſus in righteouſneſſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, hating ſinne in them ſelues and in others, no more intangle themſelus in the pleaſures of ſinne.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:14201:55"/> Men are but men, and we can doe no more then we can do, and as God will giue grace, and euery man can not be a like, neither can euery man ſhewe that which is in him, nor handle his tongue: but we hope to doe as well as the proudeſt profeſſor of them all. And a thouſand ſuch ſleightes men haue to deceiue them ſelues, and to deny chriſt in effect. Theſe are goodly ſhiftes that ſhal neuer ſtand for payment. Men are but men (ſay they).

Now God requireth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, faith, obedience, &amp;c.<note place="margin">Phil. 2.13.</note> which we can not doe, therfore he requireth more of vs, then we can doe of our ſelues, that we by his grace, may be inabled to do, that which of our ſelues we can not do. When they adde as God will giue grace, they ſeeme to charge the Lorde priuely of iniuſtice, and cleare them ſelues as faultles if they periſhe for want of grace, and ſo would blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly arraigne the Lord, as gilty of their periſhing. When they ſee not miſerable men as they are, that the cauſe is in them ſelues, that God with holdeth his graces from them. And further, how ſhoulde the Lorde giue grace to them which deſpiſe his word, and the miniſtery thereof? Whereby the Lorde conuayeth the graces of his ſpirite into the hearts of his Children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and increaſeth the ſame graces by the ſame meanes. And yet deſpiſing grace offered, like deſperate and braineleſſe men, will blame the Lorde as cauſe why they want grace. Oh ſay they, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery

Here they think they haue ſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken dead al the profeſſors at once, and haue quitted them ſelues like men, but though all haue not graces a like, yet all muſt ſtriue by like meanes to come to grace and perfection, by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent hearing, reading and muſing of the worde, by Prayer and vſe of the Sacramentes and ſuch like to grow on in holineſſe.

But let vs (my deare brethren) caſt off al delaies and not be ſluggiſh as they which are loath to riſe, to open vnto Chriſte. But willingly leape out of our beds, and renounce all worldly cares, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, profites, friendes and ſuch other hinderances as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpouſe is taught, pſa. <hi>45.10.</hi> That we may haſten to Chriſte for our liues y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may be imbraced of

In deed ſome take the <hi>putting in of the hand,</hi> for ſmiting and afflicting his Church, and ſo tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlate the worde following. <hi>And my bowels trembled at him.</hi> So the ſenſe after their meaning is, that the Church beeing ſlacke and ſlow to grow in faith and obedience, was afflicted, rebuked, and corrected of Chriſt, whereby ſhe was terrified and forced with feare, to regarde more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly the call of Chriſt Ieſus. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed true it is, that the lord calling his ſaintes, and they being very ſlow of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, he vſeth whyps and corrections to ſpurre them forwarde, of his greate loue, and we are often made more quicke and ready to obey our calling, when the Lord ſome way afflicteth vs. For our nature is ſo vntamed, ſo proud ſo lofty, ſturdy and rebellious, that the Lord is faine to ioyne with his word, many croſſes and trials, either of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, pouerty, reproch, loſſe of friends, loſſe of goods, croſſes in wiſe, in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in families, in affaires, hauing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:14201:57"/> enemies ſtirred vp againſte vs and ſuch like, that his worde and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might ſincke the more deepely into our heartes. Which fruite <hi>Dauid</hi> felt by afflictions, when he ſayd, <hi>Before I was afflicted I went wrong, but nowe I keepe thy word.</hi> Pſal. <hi>119.67.</hi> So then the Lorde is fayne to vrge vs to obey often times: Furthermore ſome ſinnes which wee ſee not a long time in oure ſelues by the worde (yet thorough our owne blindeneſſe) the Lorde by ſome rod traceth out in vs, and haleth vs foorth before his iudgement ſeat, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vs to bring in euidence againſte our ſelues, that conuicted in our owne conſcience at the bar of his iudgement ſeat, we might confeſſe our ſelues and humbly ſue for pardon. And this fruit we haue not ſimply by the affliction it ſelf, (in ſo much as the wicked alſo are afflicted oftentimes, and yet profit not by it) but being taught the vſe of it by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word, the doctrine of the word ſinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the deeper when ſome triall is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, as the ſouls that are truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled can beare good witneſſe with me
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:14201:58"/> by their owne experience, but if wee are ſtill blockiſh and ſullen, that wee murmure and briſtle vp oure affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt Gods corrections ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our hearts, though our mouthes are ſilent, and ſo not ſtirred vp to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite in repentaunce by them: then wée looſe the vſe of them. But the Spouſe ſhe trembled at the Lordes hande and roſe to open. It is a good ſigne when with reuerence men tremble at the word, ioining with that fear a purpoſe to keepe the woorde and obey it in our heart.

So then we muſt not come in our owne garmentes, but away with al beauty of nature and fleſh and blood, and on with a pure fayth and a good conſcience, in which Chriſte hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.

This ſhould not diſcourage vs, or put vs off from inquiring after God, though he ſeem to abſente him ſelfe for a time, and though wee haue not out of hande the knowledge, fayth, zeale, loue, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or that meaſure of repentaunce which wee woulde fayne haue, yea though we haue often craued for ſome grace at the hande of God, wayting long for it, and yet he ſeemeth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye it vnto vs in not graunting that grace which wee pray for: yet let vs not giue ouer, but ſtill pray and euen wraſtle with the Lorde till wee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne

            <p>This inquiring after God is a part of his worſhippe, as wee may gather from the contrary, <hi>Zephany. <hi>1.5.</hi>
               </hi> where God threatneth to cut of al that ſought not after God nor inquyred for him. So then wee ſee what a damnable ſtate all thoſe are in what ſo euer they are, which doe not ſeeke after God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in his word, and are not daily inquiring after his will to do it, but rather turn themſelues away wilfully when the Lorde ſeeketh to finde them. As they doe which contemne the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14201:62"/> woorde will not heare it, or hearing it are not mooued with Zeale to followe after God and walke in his wayes, increaſinge in the knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his will: but thinke it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen a drudgerye to bee compelled or called on to heare the woorde, or at leaſte waye counte it a needeleſſe thing.

            <p>Thus at this time we haue ſeene ſome of the letts of the ſpouſe, too mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row if God will we ſhall ſee the reſt ſo far as time ſhall permit. The Lord our good God make all this fruitefull vnto our Soules, that wee by his

Alſo we haue ſeene that the ſpouſe for ſlowing the time, had ſome what to do afterward when ſhe would faine haue found her loue that he with drew him ſelfe for a time, which was ſome trouble to her. And ſure it is when men driue off long or they come to the obedience of the Goſpel, it is a corzie to them when they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:14201:64"/> to ſee how they driue off the time with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord, &amp; God correcteth ſuch ſlac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinges in his ſaints by many means. Well here the ſpouſe inquiring after Chriſte her huſband, and hauing ouer ſtryded al lets in her ſelfe, maketh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port what lets ſhee found abroad in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And how the malice of the falſe and enuious teachers burſt out aganſt her, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they abuſed her greatly. Some vnderſtand this of the Godly teachers, that they found the Spouſe and ſmote her with reprehenſions of the worde, and tooke away the vaile of her igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce from her. But becauſe ſhe ſtill inquireth for her huſband and louer, and that of others of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> after, for that ſhe could not be ſatiſfied by the watchmen, which rather hindred her: I take it therfore without queſtion to be ment of the wicked teachers, which are ſo farre from helping forwarde of the Godly, that they pine at the zeale and diligence of Gods children labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to diſgrace them, and hazard their profeſſion to diſcredite among the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, pulling off their vaile, dealing
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:14201:64"/> roughly as royniſhe rufflers, to boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous to handle or louingly intreat the tender Spouſe of Chriſte Ieſus. Yea ſome are not aſhamed to ſaye, none are worſe then thoſe great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours and theſe that talke moſte, thus they ſtrengthen the hands of the wicked and raylers, opening the mouthes of the enemies to blaſpheme euen the Goſpell it ſelfe: diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauncing the true ſeruauntes of God, cauſing them to mourne, whome the Lorde hath not cauſed to mourne:<note place="margin">Ezek. 13.</note> but ſow pillows vnder the elbowes of the daintie and wanton people preaching peace to them, to whom the Lord hath not ſpoken peace. The Church of God hath alwayes had daungerous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, Apoſtles and teachers, which haue troubled the church, beſides thoſe which ſeduced the people with falſe doctrine. For I am fully perſwaded y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the falſe Prophets which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and other Prophets of God ſpake againſt, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> falſ Apoſtles in <hi>Pauls</hi> time, which he ſpeaketh of to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Corinthians</hi> &amp; <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s:</hi> were not al of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo called ſimply
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:14201:65"/> for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they preached falſ doctrine, but in reſpect of their miſapplying and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of doctrine. As for example to preach peace, and to cauſe to mourne is lawfull: but to preach peace to the wicked, or apply mourning to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp;c. is falſly to handle the truth. So to preach Chriſt is lawfull, but when it is done of vaine glory or contention, or to adde bondes to the ſaints of God, it is euil to the perſon that ſo doth. Yet Paule reioyced that Chriſt was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, though of contention, &amp;c. and ſure he would not haue reioyced if falſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine had beene taught by them. So we haue many no doubt which are voyd of the ſpirite of iudgement to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plye doctrine but handling it vncun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly ſmit &amp; wound the Godly, but flatter and ſtrengthen the wicked, which is no doubt a great and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſinne which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> complayned of in his <hi>13.</hi> Chapiter. We muſt be wiſe to handle the word and not min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle chaffe with wheat as <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Chapter <hi>23.28.</hi> Hereof it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that the falſe and vnfaithful tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:14201:65"/> do rather beat backe and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage thoſe that ſeeke earneſtly after Chriſte, then further them. For they enuy that the ſimple ſort ſhould grow in knowledge, leaſt their euil life, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe, ambition, flattery and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſſe in their calling ſhould be found out. Therefore the ignoraunt miniſtery they ſeeke to holde men in ignoraunce ſtill, or keepe them at a ſtay, or at leaſt way would abuſe auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to moleſt and ſuppreſſe the zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and Godly. But this ſhould not diſcourage men from inquiring after God ſtil.

And I perceiue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen here among you in theſe parts, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as the Lord hath begun a good worke in many, ſo it goeth hardly forwarde, by the reaſon of ſome daungerous watchmen &amp; miniſters, enuying the ſucceſſe of the worde preached.

               </hi> who enuied the ſimple, &amp; ſincere preaching of <hi>Amos.</hi> Therefore he complained of him to the king ſaying: <hi>Amos hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But for the moſt part they are floweſt in the lords cauſes, but let not vs tarry vppon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the more we haue forſlowed the time, the more we are bound to redéem it. The ſpouſe reſcueth her ſelfe from the abuſe of the euill watchmen, and turneth to them of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> wher the Lorde was then onely reſident by his miniſtery in his temple, inquiring of the Lorde in his lawfull and ordinary meanes, euen the miniſterye of his word, whereby both he inſtructeth his Church and the Church and faithfull againe conſult with the Lorde. We ſhoulde therefore make our recourſe to the lawfull miniſtery of the word: and cal vpon, yea: and charge our Paſtors and miniſters (if they are ſlow to the

               </hi> So that Paule woulde haue the congregation by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to ſtirre him vp.

Well let vs (my deare brethren) laboure to affect our hearts more with Chriſt Ieſus, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of al lets to ſtudie of his loue and require of all the Godlye, and of the faithfull Paſtors that they woulde further vs in this loue. The Spouſe ſeemeth to be impudent here to ſpread abroade her loue towardes her Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. For our louers are aſhamed to haue it knowne that they are ſicke of loue, ſo alſo the worlde is aſhamed to be ſick of loue for Chriſt Ieſus: but the Spouſe openly confeſſeth and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayeth
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:14201:78"/> her languiſhing after him. This ſicknes of loue many ſweet ſouls labour of, ſome that long after the worde, hauing it not at home, doe mourne for it and are faine to ſeeke els where for it: If many were ſick of that diſeaſe, there were exceeding hope of happy health for ſuch. Some poore ſoules lye panting after Chriſt, and pine for his comfort and reſidence in them, who beeing ouercharged with the ſight of their infirmities, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſelues ſo farre behind hand to ſome worthy perſons of the ſaintes of God, alſo ſo vnapt to duties, and are ſo feareful of the euidence of their owne ſinnes, deſiring to grow in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and obedience, that they thinke euery hower, manye dayes, till they haue more fully taſted of Chriſt. But to theſe Chriſte commeth willinglye and amiablye as one that will not breake a bruiſed reed, nor quench the the ſmooking flaxe.</p>
            <p>Now followeth vpon this charge a a conference betweene the ſpouſe and the maidens of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> ſtanding in

               </hi> Here they of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> inquire the cauſe why ſhee maketh more account of her wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloued then of any other, and what ſinguler thing ſhee ſaw in him more then in other. For her zeale had kindled the loue of the Godly. And <hi>Solomon</hi> purpoſely noteth herein how the Godly ſeeke to edyfie one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by religious conference. When they adde, <hi>That thou ſo chargest vs, or cauſest vs to ſweare, or takest an oth of vs,</hi> for ſo the Hebrew word importeth, as elſe where ſo in the <hi>13.</hi> Chapiter of Exodus verſe <hi>19.</hi> Where <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayth that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had made the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael ſwear, that they would cary his bones with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> For this ſpéeche is of great emphaſis
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:14201:79"/> and force, binding all men by a pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uye othe to helpe forwarde and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie one another, but (as I haue noted afore) eſpecially the Miniſters of the woorde are bounde by a ſolemne and doubble Othe as it were, to expreſſe their care this way. Theſe ſpeeches therefore are to diſcribe the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencye of loue, which ſhoulde bee in the Sayntes towardes Chriſte, that they ſhoulde neuer bee ſatiſfied with his loue. Wee therefore ſhoulde be ſtill inquiring, after Chriſte in his Church of his Seruauntes, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye of his miniſters, who ſhoulde bee the mouth of God vnto vs, till wee encreaſe and come to a full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect age in Chriſte Ieſus.<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.</note> And truely it can not bee, but where the heart is truelye taken vp with the loue of Chriſte, there will bee an excéeding ioye in his word, and a deſire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of him more and more in the ſame. The wiſeman noteth the effect of the word when it is truely reſident in the heart. Pro <hi>6.22. <hi>If my word be in thy hearte, it ſhall leade thee when thou
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:14201:79"/> walkest, it shall watch for thee when thou ſleepest, and when thou wakest it shall talk with thee,</hi>
               </hi> Meaning that when the hearte is poſſeſſed with the word, then the mind, thoughts, tongue and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are in ſome practiſe of it. So <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> Pſa. <hi>37.31. <hi>The mouth of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wil ſpeak of wiſedome, and his tongue wil talk of iudgement, for the loue of God is in his hart, and his goings shal not ſlide.</hi>
               </hi> So that the ſlack hearing of the word, the ſmal longing after it, the little ioy to talke of it, is a token of very litle loue or none at al towards Chriſt, and they are enemies to the Spouſe which being watchmen doe not comfort her, ſhewing her the way to Chriſte in his word but rather diſcourage &amp; hold her back. But let them y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truly loue Chriſt, be euer inquiring after him, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forting one another, conferring, meditating, praying, ſtirring vp one another, ſo that by theſe meanes, as the Spouſe doth here with the Godlye, wee may growe on in knowledge and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The miniſter ſhoulde alwayes bee Catechiſing his people, inquiring

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:14201:80"/> and labour not to gather togeather. For our ſluggiſheneſſe ſuffereth the kingdome of God to fall, when yet we are all called to further the ſame. <hi>He that is not with me is agaynst me</hi> (ſayth Chriſte) <hi>and he that gathereth not ſcattereth abroade.</hi>

                  </gap>y.</hi> I will not ſtand curiouſly to deſcant vpon the allegorical ſenſe of theſe figuratiue ſpeeches. But briefly note the ſenſe and meaning as I can nearelieſt gather, and after wee will make vſe generally of the vniuerſall deſcription. This whiteneſſe and rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe importeth a perfect and ſound complexion, neare approaching to the ſanguine, noting the perfection, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and ſpiritual beauty of Chriſte Ieſus. This qualitie of whitenes is a colour ſometime aſcribed to God the Father. Daniel. <hi>7.9.10.</hi> Alſo it is
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:14201:82"/> applyed to Chriſt. Apoc. <hi>1.14.</hi> noting his eternity wiſedome and deitie with his father, ſo whiteneſſe is aſcribed to him in his tranſfiguration on the mount. Alſo ſometimes the heauenly ſaintes are ſayde to be white and cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with whiteneſſe, becauſe of their glorious eſtate. But if I ſhoulde ſet down reaſons of al theſe appellations titles or Epithets I ſhould but open away to many queſtions vnneceſſary to my purpoſe, I may not purſue theſe things after ſuch ſort, but here the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, holineſſe, ſpiritual beauty and comelines of Chriſt is noted. For ſo <hi>Solomon</hi> bearing his perſonne for the time is commended for his fayreneſſe aboue others, Pſal. <hi>45.2 <hi>Ruddy.</hi>
               </hi> This colour of ruddineſſe is commended in <hi>Dauid. <hi>1.</hi>
               </hi> Sam. <hi>16.12.</hi> It importeth courage and healthfulneſſe. Some woulde haue this to bee the reaſon of this colour in Chriſt, for that he wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed ſinners in his bloud. And albeit I dare not ſay that this ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely ment of his bloudſhedding. Yet we ſee ſomtime he is deſcribed bloudy
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:14201:82"/> and of a red colour in the reſpect of his death and paſſion for our ſinnes. But here the purpoſe of <hi>Solomon,</hi> is to ſpeak worthely and honorably of Chriſt, as of a moſt comely and amiable perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, in whom nothing wanteth to a perfect and ſpiritual beauty. <hi>The cheef among ten thouſande.</hi> The ſpouſe here ſéemeth to amplifie the beauty of Chriſt from the excellency of it, that hee was ſuch a one as a man ſhoulde ſcant find againe among ten thouſand, but was as the onelye Diamonde, one picked out and ſhoaled from al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hauing alſo the préeminence ouer infinite numbers, beeing alſo as one that had don many feats of warre, and was famous for his noble exploites, worthy to weare a royal and princely Diadem. For the ſimile or Metaphor is taken from the affaires of warr, as though he were a valiant perſonage comly and ſturdy, yea euen a ſtandart bearer for a mightye Hoſt. And ſure it is that Chriſte as he is aboue all beutiful, and of a perfect temperature, ſo is he alſo head of men and Angels,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:14201:83"/> whereby he bringeth great credite and honour to his ſpouſe, aſſuring vs of his valiant courage and inuincible ſtrength, who is ready to ſauegarde and protect all that truſt in him, moſt worthy therefore to bee ſought after. We ſhoulde learne then to regiſter in our hearts al excellent things of chriſt that we might know both him as alſo the honour and benefites which we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy by him. And ſo be able to deſcribe him vnto others, and to make reports to our families, wiues, children and ſeruauntes of the greate felicitie we haue in Chriſt, by his word and ſpirit, to draw them on alſo to ſeeke Chriſts with vs in his word. Where he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed vnto vs moſt worthely and per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fectly: neither is he to be knowne els where. For the ſpouſe becommeth a very blab (if I may ſpeake ſo groſly) to blaze abroade to al men the ſecretes of her loue, but this blabbing is ſuch a qualitie as wil be ſeen in thoſe which truely loue Chriſt, as we heard afore. For ſuch as are affected truly to chriſt Ieſus louing him vnfainedly, they are
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:14201:83"/> euer talking of him, of his word, of his great riches, and of the princely dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of his heauenly inheritance, which he inricheth his Church withal. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by diſcreet and religious conference labour to towle on others. When they which neuer or ſeldom ſpeak of Chriſt with ioy, are ſo modeſt (if it be worth that title) as they bluſhe to be ſeene or heard talking of the ſcriptures or of Chriſte Ieſus. Eſpecially if any wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked perſon be in preſence, or ſcorners, they are then aſhamed of Chriſt, and ſo bewray that they are not affected with him. Now ſecondly followeth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Chriſt from the enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his parts.<note place="margin">Secondly the enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his parts.</note> verſe <hi>11. <hi>His head is as fine gould, his lockes curled and blacke as a rauen.</hi>
               </hi> When the ſpouſe ſaith that his head is as fine, ſtrong or perfect gould, ſhee meaneth that his head is moſt precious, ſplendent and ſhining for beauty. For it ſeemeth to me to be ſpoken by tranſlatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as thus, his head is gould, (that is) perfect and pure as gould is.

For looke of what account theſe precious thinges are to the outwarde man, of the ſame account and greater are the glorious things of Chriſt Ieſus to the ſaints of God. Alſo the ceremony of gold, preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtones and iewels, was in much vſe in the olde lawe, to figure vnto vs heauenly riches.

For not being able by any figures, metaphors or ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies to diſcribe him fully, ſhee in a worde ſhutteth vp al, that hee is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together amiable. When ſhe calleth him her welbeloued, ſhe noteth that as her Sutor bore good will to her, ſo ſhe alſo helde him as her dereling and beſt beloued, on whome onelye ſhee coulde finde in her hearte to beſtowe her whole loue, in calling him louer: <hi>Solomon</hi> noteth that Chriſte loued his
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:14201:96"/> Churche and Spouſe firſt, ſo as in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of him, wee ſhall loue ſuche a one as loued vs firſt. In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrence of the Spouſe with them of <hi>Ieruſalem, Solomon</hi> woulde inſinuate vnto vs, howe the Faythfull ſhould often be talking of their loue Chriſt Ieſus, confeſſinge his Ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble kindneſſe towardes them to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure others. It is one cheefe effect or token of a true calling, when a man ſyncerely delighteth in Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to bee talking of the woorde, to commende the Loue of God in Chriſte, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaythe <hi>My mouth ſhall bee alwayes telling of the louinge kindeneſſe of the Lorde, and I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo tell of thy greatneſſe.</hi> So alſo the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> Ioh. <hi>4.</hi> After ſhee was wonne by Chriſtes Sermon, contented not her ſelfe to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaynted with Chriſt her ſelfe alone, but leauing her Water pot and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſaryes, in all haſte made report of the <hi>Meſsiah</hi> to her Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures to toule on them alſo. And certaynlye when a man is truelye
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:14201:97"/> called, his deſire is kindled to make others partakers of thoſe ioyes of the worde which himſelfe dothe feele. He is alſo greeued and ſorrowfull when hee ſeeth it to bee contemned of men. Eſpeciallye ſuche couet to acquaynte theire Wife, Children, Seruauntes and Neyghboures, or thoſe which haue beene partners with them in the dayes of their vanities, with that Heauenlye meſſage of life. For wee ſhoulde bee careful that whomſoeuer wee haue offended or hurte by oure example afore, or they with whome wee haue had fellowſhippe in euill, mighte by our meanes bee broughte to a taſte of Chriſte, that wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the grace of God in Chriſte to them, might by ſome meanes draw them (if it may bee) from their vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to Chriſte. Saying: Oh that you felte the good that I feele by the woorde, for where I loued ſinne before, now I hate that, and Chriſt Ieſus is my loue. Yea let euerye one ſay to other, it pityeth my ſoule and I am couered with ſhame &amp; bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:14201:97"/> to thinke how I haue before times liued in vanitie, when I knew not Chriſt aright. But now Oh happy I, I ſee the loue of Chriſte towardes me in his worde, and I can not but loue him againe. Thus we ſhould be repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the good that we haue by Chriſte, ſeeke to make others partners with vs. If it be a duety of one Chriſtian to another, much more ſhoulde mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters towle on their people, the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands their wiues, the parentes their children, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maſters their ſeruants, &amp;c. Then who ſoeuer delight not to talke of God in his worde, but rather enuie the forwardnes of others, it is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt taken that they belong not to Chriſte. What ſhall we ſaye then of them which wil not commend Chriſt to their people, nor draw them on, but rather diſcourage and pull back? how can they haue any true loue to Chriſt them ſelues, when they are afrayde men ſhould come too neare him? Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> hath allegorically ſet before our eyes a deſcription of Chriſte Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</p>
            <pb n="178" facs="tcp:14201:98"/>
            <p>Sith then we haue preſented before our eyes ſo honorable a ſtate, ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a perſonage, ſo peereles a Prince, ſo worthy a <hi>Moſchel,</hi> wiſe and rich in al pretious iewels as <hi>Solomon,</hi> victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as <hi>Dauid,</hi> finally who is all in all, why ſhoulde we not highly account of him, honorably entertaine him, and with all ſubmiſſion ſubiect our ſelues vnto him as our onely head and guid? who ſhineth in paſſing beauty, ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in al victorious courage, in prince<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly dignity, in perfect purenes, his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite is moſt ſeemly, his comely lookes moſt gracious and amiable in the eies of his ſaints, his face wholy glorious of perfect hue, ſweete with heauenly perfumes, odoriferous with ſpirituall ſpice and ointment, his garments and attire moſt coſtly and orderly, man garments of vnſpotted righteouſneſſe, and moſt perfect holineſſe, whereby he iuſtifieth and ſanctifieth others. His breſtes, loynes &amp; al his body voyd of al carnal affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but repleniſhed with heuenly and ſpiritual, he is garniſhed with hurtles innocency, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> inuinſible

Finally ther is nothing wanting vnto Chriſt, but he is the glory of his father, the riches, the onely ioy and delight of his Father in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is wel pleaſed, being therefore in fauoure with him wee can want nothing. Who would not then be rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> offer of ſo gracious &amp; worthy a peere, who would ſtay with lingring ſteps and heauy gange to fellow faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but rather chéerefully ſo riche and friendly a louer? yea who is there, but would make al the ſpeed may be, til he were with him in his dwelling place? But it is wounder to ſee how our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bewitcheth vs, and Sathan ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth a myſt before our eyes, that we can not ſee theſe excellent thinges in chriſt Ieſus, but count him a holy baſe perſonage &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temned, becauſe he is ſo ſmally regarded of the worlde and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth at firſt bluſhe deformed and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed of men. But oh how deare is he in the eyes of God? And to his ſaints
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:14201:99"/> he is moſt amiable, they can not want him, neither wil be from him though they beg with Chriſt for a time, and haue not where on to reſt their heade, for they are ſure to enioy incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble treaſures in the end, in the meane while they behold them with the eyes of faith. But alas the miſerable world they ſee no ſuch thing. Let vs therfore (my deare brethren) make vſe of this deſcription which the Spouſe hath made of Chriſte Ieſus, that ſith we heare of him to be ſo famous, comely, perfect, innocent, holy, valiant, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, louing, kynd, yea wholy amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Alſo ſith we ſee that he aboundeth with al heauenly and eternall riches wherewith he is willing and able to pleaſure al his louers, let vs with all ioy and willingneſſe imbrace him, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him ſelfe vnto vs in his worde with al his riches: let vs beleeue his word, obey it, ioy in it, comforting our ſelues in the ſweete thinges of his mouth. Let vs yeeld to his ſuite, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming commenders of his loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes vs. Talking of his kindneſſe,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:14201:99"/> ſtirring vp others to loue him with vs, that we may proſper togeather in al true and vnfayned loue and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience towardes his maieſtie, which grace God graunt vs. Amen.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the ſecond queſtion of the conference, verſe <hi>17.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The ſecond queſtion.</note>

And ſhe (as a blab) diſcouereth the haunte of her louer, willingly conſenting to admit their fellowſhip, nay ſeeking earneſtly for it, that they may togeather imbrace
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:14201:100"/> that heauenly and ſpirituall Sutor. (For as I ſayd, it is the property of the Godly which haue in truth taſted of the loue of Chriſt to labour to draw on others, participating that ſweete and rich benefite vnto them). Finally the Spouſe after the narration of the excellencye of her loue, the more to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure others by her example, addeth an <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> or concluding ſentence in the ende in her owne perſon, aſſuring her ſelfe to be one with her loue Chriſt in a moſte holy communion, and that ſhee is a feoffy with him in al his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, affiauncing her ſelfe to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſwaded of his loue, deſiring his preſence with her all her life, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that what ſoeuer happen, come life or death, health or ſickneſſe, ſhe is her beloueds to liue and die. Yea what ſoeuer ſhalbe ſayd, or how ſo euer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than and men ſhold labor to inueagle her from his loue, yet ſhee wil be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and perſeuere in his loue to the ende. Thus ſhe whetteth and ſharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth her faith by this meanes to reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue her ſelfe vnder the ſhadow of his

            <p>Againe, they which are forward and excell others in graces, muſt take heed that vayneglorie vndermind not their heartes, or that contempt and ſcorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe do not ſet them afloate, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe or neglecte their brethren, or to condemne thoſe that are not ſo far for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:14201:107"/> as themſelues, but with all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable modeſtie labour to incourage and drawe them on. O that we could ſtriue with a godly enuie one to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe another in godlineſſe, yet ſo that by our godly counſell and holy life we might bee meanes to ſtirre vp others, procuring them to a holy emulation. It is reported in the fourth chapiter of <hi>Iohn</hi> his Goſpell, what good the report and example of the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> did in that citie where ſhee dwelled, to allure many of that place to beleeue in Chriſt, which were after more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in fayth by Chriſt himſelfe. So we ſhould labour that not onely they of our owne houſhold, pariſhe or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, ſhoulde bee occaſioned by vs to ſeeke after God, but it were to bee wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed that the ſtate of the Church of our lande were ſuch thorowout, as that wee beeing gouerned all according to godly Diſcipline, in moſte hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie and religious manner, the worde of GOD hauinge preheminence in all places, perſonnes and cauſes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen other Nations: yea, the Iewes

God forbid, but through their fall ſaluation commeth to the Gentiles to prouoke the Iewes to emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> or <hi>to follow the Gentiles.</hi> For to this ende God adopteth the Gentiles into the place of the Iewes, that they ſéeing the Gentiles ioyned vnto God, perceiuing alſo the fruit of their faith, they might be ſet on fire to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto God againe, repenting them of their falling from him, that ſo with the Gentiles they might againe bee flocked into the fellowſhip of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church. And certainely we al incurre a great and blameable fault, that we are no more touched with pitty ouer the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Iewes, by whoſe fal we were lift vp into the Church, whoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing is our riches, that we pitty

For I ſee not the contrary but that the Lord will yet bring backe again ſome of the Iewes to his trueth, that they may be turned to their God, though the moſt of the nation periſh in blindneſſe. Let vs then beſtow vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them this curteſie, to pray for their conuerſion, and to liue ſo in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe our ſelues, that the Iewes and all other, may ſee that we feare and ſerue the true and liuing God. That ſo they may be mooued by our meanes, to ſeeke Chriſte Ieſus with vs, beeing parteners with vs of that health, the foundation whereof ſprong to vs from the Iewes. <hi>For the redeemer ſhal come vnto Sion and to them that turne from iniquity in Iacob.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſay. 59.20.</note> We are therefore ſore to be blamed, when we ſo ſcornefully reproch the Nation of the Iewes, that when we woulde ſpeake diſdainefully of any man, we thinke we can not ſpeake more hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly,

But this is a token of vnchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, vnreligious and vnchriſtian heartes. Let vs therefore offer them this kindeneſſe, to wiſhe well to them and all others, to labour to towle on others, as the Spouſe doeth in this place, that they may with vs goe to ſeeke the Lorde of hoſtes, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſte Ieſus. Thus ſhoulde wee further one another to Chriſte, for wee are exceeding negligent this waye, to redeeme our former times of vanitye ſpente with our brethren.

Theſe fruites that the Lorde gathereth and reapeth at oure handes are his owne then, inſomuch as he worketh them in his ſaints that he may receiue his owne with aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, crowning his owne workes in vs. It were expedient therefore that we labour to be fruitful in all heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye knoweledge and obedience, that Chriſte comming downe to viſite his Garden or church, (as it is ſet down in the ſixt Chap. ver. <hi>10.</hi>) he finde vs not empty or fruitleſſe, that he ſhould haue no pleaſure in vs, and ſo bee forced to caſt vs vp to the ſpoyle.

Thus many Cankers breede in the bowels of the church, hereſies, fonde opinions, fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, Brouniſts, and ſuch other. Thus by ſuch meanes (as lamentable it is to ſee) the graft of godlineſſe and zeale is hindred. And through the neglect of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers &amp; magiſtrates rather then laws, theſe beaſtes ſwarme in our Church. Alſo drunkards, ſwearers, whores, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers, proude pecockes, raylers,

Which al ſhold be cut off by diſcipline or at leaſt way bee forced to ſome reformation. Can it be that the Lord wil truſt vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer with a Leaſe of his garden? we abuſing him in ſuch maner, ſo as we greeue the Lords ſoul with our vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>faithfulnes and cauſe his ſoule to hate vs.<note place="margin">Eſay. 1.14.</note> Who beſtoweth ſuch coſt on vs &amp; we proſper ſo little, as hee can gather very few Lillies amongſt vs, he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the fruit of our hearts and lippes, as faith, loue, feare, obedience, charity, thankeſgiuing, prayſe, inuocation, hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring his word, profeſſing his name, &amp;c.

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:14201:114"/> and the ſpoyle of religion, howe hardly the Lordes garden ſhould be at al kept without them. But our ſinnes, yea our contempt and neglect of the word of God and his glory, doe hinder the Lorde from bleſſing vs with that encreaſe which otherwiſe wee mighte enioy, yea our ſinnes betraye the ſtate of our Churche and lande, and deſerue the loſſe of ſo Princely a <hi>Deborah,</hi> and other woorthye perſonnages where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with our Church is inriched, yea that the Lorde ſhoulde take away all the walles and defences of our church and land, &amp; giue vs ouer to the ſpoile.

We ſee that it is deſcribed vnto vs by many ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes in the ſcriptures, wherein moſt liuely, effectually, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortably that holy, ſpiritual and ſacred ſociety wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:14201:117"/> we are incorporate into Chriſte is diſcouered. As in the <hi>15.</hi> Chapiter of the Euangeliſt <hi>Saint Iohn:</hi> our ſauiour Chriſte vnder the parable of a Vine and the branches, ſheweth the mutual loue betweene him and his members, as alſo the ſweet coniunction whereby they are neceſſarily ioyned togeather, that the life of the one ſtandeth not without the life of the other, and the perfection of the one is not without the perfection of the other. For Chriſte hath inſeperably ioyned all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful vnto him ſelfe, ſo as without them hee counteth him ſelfe as it were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> Epheſ. <hi>1.23.</hi> after hee had magnified the grace of God towarde the elect, and highly commended the excellency of Chriſte Ieſus whome God had made the head of his Church, he concludeth that the Church as it is the body of Chriſt, ſo it is <hi>his fulneſse.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, in that God the Father hath orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his Sonne to bee the heade of his Church, euen as the head with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the body, is not full but vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:14201:118"/> and the body wanting any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is not in al parts complete, ſo with out the number of his ſaintes which ſhold fulfil the miſtical body of Chriſt, euen Chriſte him ſelfe is after a ſort vnperfect. Not that hee is ſo in him ſelfe, for he is in his owne nature full infinite, and perfect admitting neither <hi>maius</hi> nor <hi>minus.</hi> But this is the riches of his grace that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ath ſo vnited eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of his ſaints and elect vnto him, as he can not want any one of them. The force of this ſpeech is wonderful to him that hath the eyes of faith, and exceedingly comfortable to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled conſcience, which hath once in trueth taſted of the mercies and grace of God, in whome alſo the worke of faith hath béen truely begun, though it be ſometime in a dampe and as it were ſmoothered vp, yea it can not but rauiſhe them to ſee that Chriſt cannot want nor cut of any member that hee hath once begun to graft into him ſelf. But as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Vines and ſuch like plantes euery braunch thereof receiueth iuyce, moyſture, life and nouriſhment from
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:14201:118"/> the ſtocke and root, hath alſo a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry communitie with the ſtocke in all thinges, ſo as from the ſtocke or root is conueyed life and nouriſhment to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery braunch: ſo euery faithful perſon which is in Chriſt receiue from him al neceſſary iuyce and ſupplement, to the nouriſhing and preſeruing of a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life in them. Though ſometime ſome of the braunches hang the head, but yet they which are planted of the heauenly Father, ſhal neuer be cut off but ſhal haue life eternal with Chriſt Ieſus. This thing alſo is ſet foorth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs in the ſimile of a body euen of the head and the members. Therefore (as I ſayd) Chriſt is called the head of the Churche, Epheſ. <hi>1.22.</hi> Col. <hi>1.18.</hi> For there is a mutual <hi>analogie</hi> and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, betwetne the head and the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and Chriſt &amp; his Church. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole Churche conſidered in Chriſt and his members, is called not only a body but alſo it is called by the name of Chriſt. <hi>1.</hi> Cor. <hi>12.12.</hi> So as there is a neceſſary vnitie betweene Chriſt and his members, wherby they
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:14201:119"/> are made one, therefore followeth in the <hi>13.</hi> verſe. of that Chapter, that <hi>by one ſpirite we are al baptized into one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, whether Iewes or Gentiles, bonde or free.</hi> Wherein the holye and ſwéete Communion betweene Chriſte and his members is layde foorth, ſo as verſe. <hi>27.</hi> hee concludeth, nowe you <hi>are the body of Chriſt, &amp; members for your part,</hi> noting that they alone without other churches, were not the bodye of Chriſt, but they with al other ſhold be aſſociate to the church in al times and places. Furthermore certain it is, that as the body can not bee abſolutely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, if it want any, euen the leaſt mem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber, ſo Chriſte counteth not himſelfe perfect til he hath euery one of his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, namely the beléeuers vnited vnto him. And this body of Chriſt which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, receiueth life from him, yea euery me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber is nouriſhed, kept &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tained by one &amp; the ſame ſpirit, which being derided from Chriſt, ſpreadeth it ſelfe by equall meaſure according to the proportion of fayth into euery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer. So as the ſpirite of God is as it
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:14201:119"/> were the ſoule of the Church, whereby euery member receiueth of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Chriſt, being quickened by him, &amp; liuing by a common life with Chriſt, whereby they are aſſured that they are one with him, and haue life in him. So as <hi>Paul. Gal. <hi>2.20.</hi>
               </hi> teſtifieth that when he was in Chriſte, he liued not, but Chriſt liued in him. And albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it the members of Chriſt haue not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a like feeling of life in them ſelues, but ſomtime they ſeeme to be benumbed and a colde as it were, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge no nimbleneſſe or agilitye in them ſelues, yea as it were a ſleepe and voyd of feeling, ſo as they ſcantly can haue comfort, that they are of the body of Chriſt, yet this hindreth not, but that they are ioined ſtill to theire heade, ſith it is as impoſſible that any member, that is truelye grafted into Chriſte ſhoulde periſhe, bee cut or wante lyfe, as it is impoſſible that Chriſte him ſelfe ſhoulde wante life. I ſpeake this in the reſpecte of the free grace of God, communicating lyfe vnto vs in Chriſte, alſo for the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:14201:120"/> comfort of ſuch poore ſoules, as beeing graffed into Chriſte by faith, hauing alſo felt of the power of his death and reſurrection in truth, in that they are refourmed from their former wayes and deſire to pleaſe God in holineſſe, yet in the preſent feeling of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and imperfections can not haue comfort, but lye as poore members wounded and panting for life for the time, when yet life is not vtterly out of them. As for the bold and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſinner or libertine, as he neuer taſted of the life which is in Chriſt, by mortification and ſanctification, ſo he hath no warrant yet that hee is of Chriſt, and therefore I can not aſſure any ſuch of the certainty of that life. This vnity and coniunction is alſo fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured vnto vs in the ſimile of a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or houſe. For we are all lyuely ſtones of a ſpiritual building, couched and layd vpon Chriſt Ieſus the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and corner ſtone of the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. As <hi>1.</hi> Pet. <hi>2.4.5.</hi> So that as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtones couched and placed together in order do make one building, euen ſo
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:14201:120"/> Chriſt and his members become one ſpiritual houſe. Alſo as as the breade and wine receiued into our bodies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one with our nature and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce, ſo Chriſte and his members become one and are as it were incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate togeather. They therfore which by faith receiue Chriſte Ieſus in the Sacramentes, applying him with all his riches and mercies vnto them ſelues, may conclude with the ſpouſe, <hi>I am my beloueds and my beloued is mine, &amp;c.</hi> But this ſpirituall ſocietie and coniunction is moſt liuely naturally and comfortably portraitured out vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, in the vnion and fellowſhippe which is betweene man and wife, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> doth worthely men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the fift chapiter of his Epiſtle to the Epheſians, verſe <hi>30.</hi> affirming that we are members of Chriſtes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of his fleſhe and of <hi>his bones.</hi> And what more nearer ſocietie of life is there then that which is betweene man and wife, who of two are made one fleſhe, haue al thinges common, are a like intiteled to all commoidties
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:14201:121"/> and riches, the one hath a right vnto the other, that they are ſequeſtred from all other to haue and retayne a perfect and continuall ſociety in them ſelues? The ſocietye of Parentes and children is great, of maſters and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts as part of a houſhold, the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety alſo of brethren and kindred. But this exceedeth all other, yea it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred aboue all other Societyes, as moſte comfortable, neere, ſecrete and continuall. But ſuch is the infinite loue of God towards vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath not onely affianced vs to his Sonne as friendes and brethren, but euen made vs one with him and he with vs. Oh Heauenly, holye, comfortable and moſte ſweet fellowſhip. No mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell then though the Spouſe here ſo cheerefullye and confidentlye affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that ſhee is <hi>her beloueds,</hi> and her <hi>beloued is hers:</hi> wherein ſhee doth not onely ioy that ſhe is one with her beloued, but alſo aduoucheth her faith to him, warranting her ſelfe of all his rich, Heauenlye and incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dowrye. Thus all the beleeuers
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:14201:121"/> ſhoulde labour to aſſure them ſelues of this holye vnion and ſociety with Chriſt, being perſwaded that not only the heauenly Saints, or the excellent ſeruants of God which exceed others in holines, knowledge and godlines, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles, Paſtors, Preachers or ſuche like are one in Chriſt, and ſo happy: but euery faithfull man and woman muſt be aſſured in ſome meaſure, by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of adoption that they are one with him. For ſometime Satan would vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermind the poore afflicted ſouls which are ſnarled in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience of their own infirmityes &amp; corruptions, perſwading them that though the Church be one in Chriſt, neither can be ſeperate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him alſo the prophets, apoſtles, godly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, or ſuche in whome they ſee greater graces far way then in them ſelues, they eaſily gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſuch are happy &amp; may be ſure of ſaluation in Chriſte. But I miſerable wretch y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I am (ſaith the poore afflicted conſcience, humbled in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſight &amp; loathing of the corruptions &amp; remnants of ſinne) I am not like to them: I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not haue that ioy in Chriſt,

Alſo I haue ſuch vile, damnable and helliſhe thoughts come vpon me ſometime, as I thinke it is impoſſible the children of God ſhoulde be troubled with, eſpecially when I woulde rathereſt prepare my ſelfe to heare the word reuerently, or to pray faythfully. Therefore I can not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelfe that I am one with Chriſte and ſhal neuer be cut off from him. Many ſuch like thinges I know ariſe in the heartes of the Godly ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and many ſuch replies diſpute in their thoughtes and mindes often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, whereby Sathan woulde faine make them weary of the meanes of their ſaluation, and becauſe they can not profit by them as they would, and when they would, therefore they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect them ſelues, calling their owne
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:14201:144"/> eſtate into queſtion not hauing for the time anye comforte, in this holy and comfortable ſocietie whiche is in Chriſte. Thus poore ſoules they many times are troubled with their owne ſhadow, euen then when they ſtriue to come neare to Chriſte, and are in deed neareſt to him ſome time, when they thinke them ſelues furtheſt off. But ſuch is the loue of our God that he hideth it from vs, that we may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be the ſurer of it. Howbeit certaine it is (if I may ſpeake from experience in my ſelfe and ſome others, whoſe ſtate I haue been priuy vnto) that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times ſuch replyes afore mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, namely that we are inferiours to other in knowledge, in zeal, in praier, &amp;c. whereby we faint and ſuſpect our ſelues and ſuch like motions as riſe vp in our ſelues, ſpring partly from a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creat enuye ſometime in our nature which is not ſeene to our ſelues, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of our incredulitie and of other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities in vs, as alſo partly of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans mallice which wold diſcourage the godly from vſing the means wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

But howſoeuer it be, theſe motions ſpring of our nature, the roote wherof is incredulity and want of faith, yet ſo that ſuch motions as hurtfull as they are, yet are they not vtterly voyd of faith. For a certaine ſound ſead of faith remayneth in the ſaints of God, euen in theſe tumults and vprores of of the minde, in ſo much as there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth a certaine earneſt lingring in their hearts towardes Chriſt, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to be aſſured of the truth of Gods promiſe in them ſelues, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne euerlaſting life, yea and deſiring to feele that comfort of his loue which for the time they can not feele.

For this continual ſocietie or vnity of Chriſt with his Church, is not for a time but for euer, not onely in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole Church, but alſo in euery particuler member thereof.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.35.38.39.</note>

The head is eternal, therfore the body and members are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal. The foundation of that ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al houſe neuer decayeth, therfore ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the building. The huſband of the Church is euerlaſting and can not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe, therefore the company of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers which are his wife can neuer periſhe. For the reaſon of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of theſe argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, ſtandeth in the nature of thoſe qualities that are in God, and not in the nature of the things them ſelues. For as Chriſt can not ceaſe to be eternal no more then his father can, ſo the ſtate of the godly can not ceaſe to be eternal, vnles God and Chriſt ſhoulde ceaſe from their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. For whatſoeuer quality is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident in the nature of God, is alwais the ſame becauſe the Godhead is not mutable nor contrary in it ſelfe, but
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:14201:146"/> alway like it ſelfe. Wherefore vnleſſe God and Chriſt ſhold ceaſe to be them ſelues, the Church or beleeuers which were elect before al time can not ceaſe to be eternal, in ſo much as the loue wherewith he loueth his eternal and cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth not. For Io. <hi>13.1. <hi>Thoſe whom he loueth, to the ende he loueth them.</hi>
               </hi> So that the Godly which haue once in truth taſted of the loue of God, can no more periſhe then the loue of God it ſelfe can periſh, or his mercy come to an end. This cauſeth the ſpouſe in the confidence of Gods fauor to aſſure her ſelfe that Chriſt is hers. Now as this is true in the whole Church that it is permanent and can not periſhe but be ſaued. So is it true in euery member, wherby they may be aſſured of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them ſelues and of their perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. How ſoeuer the Papiſts would hold ſoules in vnſtablenes, in ſuſpence and doubt of their ſaluation alway. Certaine it is, that in ſome meaſure, the children of God haue aſſuraunce of their ſaluation in this life, though not at al times alike, nor al men alike aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance.
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:14201:147"/> That the Church or elect in general can not but be ſaued, there is no man I ſuppoſe that doubteth.

Tim. 1.5</note> and a pure heart which ſpring from faith which is careful to pleaſe God, ſo as ſuch haue no fayth but an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of fayth. Neuertheles I affirm it to be true, that the ſinns, infirmities and falles of the Saintes of God can not fruſtrate their ſaluation, becauſe God looketh not on them but in Chriſte. Shall this therefore ad courage vnto men to ſinne? God forbid: nay they which are truelye humbled as they know, that God wil not for their ſins caſt them away. So they dare not for their liues to ſinne vpon hope, though they are manye times foyled ſore of their infirmities. So that although I herein miniſter comfort to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſoule, ſo I muſt ſay to thoſe that preſume vpon theſe great and eternal riches of Gods grace, making his mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cies a bawde for their ſinnes: certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:14201:149"/> they are without all true loue to God, and muſt not once looke for any comfort, but be aſſured that as yet they are voyde of the benefite of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and are in a damnable and Helliſhe eſtate. For beeing without the Church, in that they ſhew foorth no fruites of obedience to the worde, &amp;c. they can not looke for ſaluation, ſith without the Church there is no ſaluation. Without <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke was no life. All periſhed in <hi>Iericho</hi> that were not in <hi>Rachabs</hi> houſe, ſo in the Church onely is ſaluation, without, nothing but hell and damnation. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man therefore muſt labour to be a member of the church of Chriſt, yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding obedience to the calling of God by the preaching of his word that they maye bee flocked into his folde and Church. For men muſt know that election muſt not be ſeuered from an effectuall calling which worketh in time in the true beleeuers. It is a bleſſedneſſe in deed that we are elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but if our election be not ratified by the ſpirite of ſanctification, and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:14201:149"/> that we haue not good euidence of it in our owne conſcience, what ſhal it boot vs? Therefore the Pſalme <hi>65.4.</hi> After they of the Church had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playned of their ſinnes as lets to their Prayers before God, ſo as they beganne to ſuſpect their owne eſtate becauſe of ſinne, they conclude to the comforte of their conſcience, that their bleſſedneſſe ſtood not in them ſelues, but in the election of God. <hi>Bleſsed is be whom thou chooſest and cauſest to come vnto thee.</hi> So as theſe two are ioyned togeather, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly election and calling, or vocation in the paſſiue ſenſe (that is) that God cauſeth his to come, for none come of them ſelues. Now therefore it is expedient that we make our election ſure by good workes.<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.10.</note> Yet muſte we not meaſure our election by our good workes or the perfection of them. For we ſee when the ſeruants of God ſuruey their hearts to gather comfort by their calling, or by thoſe graces which they haue taſted off, to looke on their faith, hope, obedience, loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:14201:150"/> God or their neighbours, alaſſe when they ouerlook al their beſt works that they can reckon vp, yet they can not haue comfort in them, if they ſhall onely ſtay in them: but they muſt from the effectes of theire calling (which if they be in trueth are good euidences and argumentes of comfort) looke into this originall of their happineſſe, <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is be whom thou chuſest. &amp;c.</hi> For this is the fountaine of bleſſed es vnto vs. Then in the ſecond place we may ſay, bleſſed is hee whome God cauſeth to come to him, and he y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feareth God, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and obeying his worde careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vnfeinedly, &amp;c. Which al fruits of our calling are not cauſes of oure happineſſe, but teſtimonies and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes through the earneſt of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite that we are happy.</p>
            <p>But it may ſeeme ſomewhat na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly affirmed of the Spouſe without proofe, when ſhe profeſſeth her ſelfe to be her beloueds and that her beloued is hers, when ſhe addeth no reaſon of it. For albeit many grant that they which are truely in Chriſt, and in the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:14201:150"/> fauour of God they are happy, they can not but doe wel and are of the ſure grounde. But here ſtandeth the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and difficulty of the cauſe, howe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man may knowe that hee hath part in that vnity of Chriſte, and how a man maye bee ſure of ſaluation in this life. To come to this point, wee muſt firſt conſider that that which is ſpoken in the ſcriptures concerning the ſaluation of the Church or elect in general, with the cauſes &amp; effects ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is ſpoken alſo of euery member of the Church, and is true in both. As for example, if it bee true, that the Churche or Elect were loued and elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God before the beginninges of the Worlde, then this is true, euerye faythfull beleeuer was elected before al times. Agayne if the Churche bee called to the participation of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, then euery faithful belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is. Alſo if the Churche bee holye, then euery one of the Churche is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in time called to bee holy. If the church be redeemed and the ſinnes ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of pardoned, that it be ſanctified, iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:14201:151"/> ſaued and glorified in the ende, then euerye beleeuer (which is of the church) is redeemed, his ſinnes pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is iuſtified, ſanctified in time, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and glorified in the ende. If the Church or elect in general can not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but is permanent, induring and ſure of ſaluation, then neither any one member of the church can periſh nor be loſt, but is permanent and ſure of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Nowe this wee muſt conſider when I ſpeake of the aſſurance of the Children of God: I vnderſtande not ſuch a certantye as is not mingled at all with any doubtfulneſſe. For the beſt aſſured is not alwayes alyke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of his ſaluation, neyther haue all men a like feeling of the comfort and aſſurance of eternall health. For ſometime it is in the Ecclipſe, and the comfort of Gods fauour, is intercepted from vs by the cloudes of our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſo as the eyes of our faith are daze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. But at ſometimes at leaſt, the Children of God haue ſome good aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of their ſaluation, though for the moſt part they ſeeme to hang in a
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:14201:151"/> mammering. Alſo otherſome haue not ſo full a ſight of it as others haue. Partly becauſe of manye corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in their nature, which they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour not ſo earneſtly to purge as they ought. Partly alſo becauſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of faith or the knowledge of God is not a like in al, but ſome more ſome leſſe. But we ſhall in vayne ſpeake of the aſſuraunce of the grace of perſeueraunce or certaintie of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, vnleſſe we looke vpon the head ſpring of Gods mercyes in Chriſte Ieſus, with the eyes of faith and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berneſſe: alſo vnleſſe we haue the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony and earneſt peny of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God, whereby we are ſealed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the day of redemption. <hi>For if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man haue not the ſpirite of Christ, he is not his.</hi> Rom. <hi>8,</hi> verſe. <hi>9.</hi>

I know our nature wil neuer make an end of replying againſt the certainty of our ſaluation, becauſe of the imperfections and infirmities of the Children of God beeing ful of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt many times. For when we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our eſtate in our ſelues, howe wee are ſhort of all duties, vnfitte to ſerue our God in al true obedience, finding many treaſons and rebellions in our ſelues, being ignorant in his truth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo when we profite not by the word, by praier, neyther preuayle as we would agaynſt our imperfections, infirmities and corruptions: then we doubt of the Lordes loue towards vs, ſuſpecting of his work in vs, fearing leaſt al our for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer profeſſion be in vain, and can ſee nothing that ſhould giue vs comfort of the fauour of God towardes vs. Thus we ſuppoſe the loue of God and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to be inconſtant, meaſuring them
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:14201:158"/> by our infirme and weake faith, or by the ſcant meaſure of our obedience.

Can it be that when the Lorde loued vs before we were, ye when we were his enemies, before our calling of his free mercye, that he wil now loath vs, leaue and forſake vs vtterly when he hath begun his owne worke in vs? Could he loue vs when we were in our ſinnes without remorſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: and can he now hate vs when we indeuour to leaue our ſinnes and are vexed that we can no more grow in godlineſſe and obedience? Could he loue vs when we were voyde of his

Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hypocrites ſome of them may come to theſe pointes, to be lightened with knowledge, to taſt of the heauenly gift to be partakers of the holy Ghoſt, (con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cerning the giftes thereof, though not of the ſpirite of ſanctification in them ſelues) to taſt of the good word of God for the time, and of the powers of the world to come. Thus farre may hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites goe, which yet becauſe they are not refourmed vnto the image of God, and taſt not in truth of the ſpirit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, they are but as vanitye and ſhall periſh as the ſmoke. Thoſe points I note to the end that the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked hypocrites might not preſume vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this doctrine of comfort, for the ſaints of God that truely begin to taſt of regeneration, &amp; that the godly alſo might bee humbled to examine their heartes that they maye bee ſure, that though the meaſure of grace in them be ſcant, yet that it be ſound and in
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:14201:162"/> truth in them. I can not ſtande to ſet downe the <hi>Antitheſies</hi> and oppoſitions of the qualities of the hypocrites and of the Godly, to ſhewe in particulers wherin theſe things differ, yet I know if time woulde ſerue it were profitable for the children of God. Neither can I ſtand to ſhew of the other ſide how far the Godly may ſlyde and yet be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, and the difference of the fals of the hypocrites and of the righteous and beleeuers. For true it is that the ſaints of God though they can not vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly fal away from God or from grace (as we haue already prooued). Yet ſome of them ſome times fal very far, yea and that not only before their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but alſo after they haue truely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of grace. If I ſhould recken vp the fal of <hi>Noah</hi> after the flood, the fall of <hi>Lot,</hi> the fall of <hi>Dauid, Solomon, Peter,</hi> which fel into groſſe ſinnes after their calling: (For, as for the example of <hi>Paule, Magdalen, Mathew, Zacheus,</hi> who were notoryous ſinners afore their calling, and were truly conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: theſe examples ſtand not ſo fitly to
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:14201:162"/> this point which I ſpeake of, but the other ſinning after their calling, for theſe after ſinnes, be they that wound ſome of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaints of God ſo déepely) if I ſay I ſhould mention the example of them ſinning after their calling, no man muſt be ſo bolde to preſume to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate their ſinnes by them, or boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter their fals by their ſlydings (as the hypocrites doe againſt whome the wrath of God ſhall ſmoke). But the children of God they may ſée ſomwhat hereby how farre ſome of the Godly ſlide ſometime and are recouered. But theſe ſinned not vpon preſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but of infirmitie. So that the corruption of nature preuailing, Gods ſpirit was buried as it were for the time. But if men by their ſlidinges are not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſtande the ſurer after, hauing their heartes more kindled with the hatred of ſinne, and are not made more watchfull ouer their infirmities pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more againſt them, purpoſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte them, faſting and mourning for them, ſo as they gather the more ſtrength thereby to withſtande the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:14201:163"/> ſtronglier after, then let them beware leaſt their eſtate indéede be moſt daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and miſerable, but thus much in a word of this thing for I mencion theſe circumſtances, becauſe of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teintie which the ſaints of God haue in this life, that none might deceiue them ſelues vnder a coulour of hope, vnles they féele the true work of ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification in them, though but begun &amp; not yet perfited which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be til the comming of Ieſus Chriſt.
